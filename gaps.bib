   abstract = {For spectroscopic measurements, there are good reasons why one might consider using nonuniformly nonsimultaneously sampled complex data. The primary one is that the effective bandwidth, the largest spectral window free of aliases, can be much wider than with uniformly sampled data. In this article, we discuss nonuniformly nonsimultaneously sampled data, describe how these data are traditionally analyzed, analyze them using probability theory, and show how probability theory generalizes the discrete Fourier transform: first for uniformly sampled data, then for nonuniformly sampled data, and finally for nonuniformly nonsimultaneously sampled data. These generalizations demonstrate that aliases are not so much removed by nonuniform nonsimultaneous sampling as they are moved to much higher frequencies. (C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

   abstract = {NMR spectroscopy is one of the most powerful and versatile analytic tools available to chemists. The discrete Fourier transform (DFT) played a seminal role in the development of modem NMR, Including the multidimensional methods that are essential for characterizing complex biomolecules. However, it suffers from well-known limitations: chiefly the difficulty in obtaining high-resolution spectral estimates from short data records. Because the time required to perform an experiment is proportional to the number of data samples, this problem imposes a sampling burden for multidimensional NMR experiments. At high magnetic field, where spectral dispersion is greatest, the problem becomes particularly acute. Consequently multidimensional NMR experiments that rely on the DFT must either sacrifice resolution in order to be completed in reasonable time or use inordinate amounts of time to achieve the potential resolution afforded by high-field magnets.
Maximum entropy (MaxEnt) reconstruction is a non-Fourier method of spectrum analysis that can provide high-resolution spectral estimates from short data records. It can also be used with nonuniformly sampled data sets. Since resolution Is substantially determined by the largest evolution time sampled, nonuniform sampling enables high resolution while avoiding the need to uniformly sample at large numbers of evolution times. The Nyquist sampling theorem does not apply to nonuniformly sampled data, and artifacts that occur with the use of nonuniform sampling can be viewed as frequency-aliased signals. Strategies for suppressing nonuniform sampling artifacts include the careful design of the sampling scheme and special methods for computing the spectrum. Researchers now routinely report that they can complete an N-dimensional NMR experiment 3(N-1) times faster (a 3D experiment in one ninth of the time). As a result, high-resolution three- and four-dimensional experiments that were prohibitively time consuming are now practical. Conversely, tailored sampling in the indirect dimensions has led to Improved sensitivity.
Further advances in nonuniform sampling strategies could enable further reductions In sampling requirements for high resolution NMR spectra, and the combination of these strategies with robust non-Fourier methods of spectrum analysis (such as MaxEnt) represent a profound change in the way researchers conduct multidimensional experiments. The potential benefits will enable more advanced applications of multidimensional NMR spectroscopy to study biological macromolecules, metabolomics, natural products, dynamic systems, and other areas where resolution, sensitivity, or experiment time are limiting. Just as the development of multidimensional NMR methods presaged multidimensional methods in other areas of spectroscopy, we anticipate that nonuniform sampling approaches will find applications in other forms of spectroscopy.},

New procedures need to be developed beyond uniform sampling of the indirect dimensions and reconstruction methods other than the straight FFT are necessary. Here we discuss approaches of non-uniform sampling (NUS) and suitable reconstruction methods.

   abstract = {Modern high-field NMR instruments provide unprecedented resolution. To make use of the resolving power in multidimensional NMR experiment standard linear sampling through the indirect dimensions to the maximum optimal evolution times (similar to 1.2 T-2) is not practical because it would require extremely long measurement times. Thus, alternative sampling methods have been proposed during the past 20 years. Originally, random nonlinear sampling with an exponentially decreasing sampling density was suggested, and data were transformed with a maximum entropy algorithm (Barna et al., J Magn Reson 73:69-77, 1987). Numerous other procedures have been proposed in the meantime. It has become obvious that the quality of spectra depends crucially on the sampling schedules and the algorithms of data reconstruction. Here we use the forward maximum entropy (FM) reconstruction method to evaluate several alternate sampling schedules. At the current stage, multidimensional NMR spectra that do not have a serious dynamic range problem, such as triple resonance experiments used for sequential assignments, are readily recorded and faithfully reconstructed using non-uniform sampling. Thus, these experiments can all be recorded non-uniformly to utilize the power of modern instruments. On the other hand, for spectra with a large dynamic range, such as 3D and 4D NOESYs, choosing optimal sampling schedules and the best reconstruction method is crucial if one wants to recover very weak peaks. Thus, this chapter is focused on selecting the best sampling schedules and processing methods for high-dynamic range spectra.},

   abstract = {The fast Fourier transformation has been the gold standard for transforming data from time to frequency domain in many spectroscopic methods, including NMR. While reliable, it has as a drawback that it requires a grid of uniformly sampled data points. This needs very long measuring times for sampling in multidimensional experiments in all indirect dimensions uniformly and even does not allow reaching optimal evolution times that would match the resolution power of modern high-field instruments. Thus, many alternative sampling and transformation schemes have been proposed. Their common challenges are the suppression of the artifacts due to the non-uniformity of the sampling schedules, the preservation of the relative signal amplitudes, and the computing time needed for spectra reconstruction. Here we present a fast implementation of the Iterative Soft Thresholding approach (istHMS) that can reconstruct high-resolution non-uniformly sampled NMR data up to four dimensions within a few hours and make routine reconstruction of high-resolution NUS 3D and 4D spectra convenient. We include a graphical user interface for generating sampling schedules with the Poisson-Gap method and an estimation of optimal evolution times based on molecular properties. The performance of the approach is demonstrated with the reconstruction of non-uniformly sampled medium and high-resolution 3D and 4D protein spectra acquired with sampling densities as low as 0.8%. The method presented here facilitates acquisition, reconstruction and use of multidimensional NMR spectra at otherwise unreachable spectral resolution in indirect dimensions.},

   abstract = {It is well established that non-uniform sampling (NUS) allows acquisition of multi-dimensional NMR spectra at a resolution that cannot be obtained with traditional uniform acquisition through the indirect dimensions. However, the impact of NUS on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and sensitivity are less well documented. SNR and sensitivity are essential aspects of NMR experiments as they define the quality and extent of data that can be obtained. This is particularly important for spectroscopy with low concentration samples of biological macromolecules. There are different ways of defining the SNR depending on how to measure the noise, and the distinction between SNR and sensitivity is often not clear. While there are defined procedures for measuring sensitivity with high concentration NMR standards, such as sucrose, there is no clear or generally accepted definition of sensitivity when comparing different acquisition and processing methods for spectra of biological macromolecules with many weak signals close to the level of noise. Here we propose tools for estimating the SNR and sensitivity of NUS spectra with respect to sampling schedule and reconstruction method. We compare uniformly acquired spectra with NUS spectra obtained in the same total measuring time. The time saving obtained when only 1/k of the Nyquist grid points are sampled is used to measure k-fold more scans per increment. We show that judiciously chosen NUS schedules together with suitable reconstruction methods can yield a significant increase of the SNR within the same total measurement time. Furthermore, we propose to define the sensitivity as the probability to detect weak peaks and show that time-equivalent NUS can considerably increase this detection sensitivity. The sensitivity gain increases with the number of NUS indirect dimensions. Thus, well-chosen NUS schedules and reconstruction methods can significantly increase the information content of multidimensional NMR spectra of challenging biological macromolecules.},

   abstract = {The Nyquist theorem stipulates the largest sampling interval Sufficient to avoid aliasing is the reciprocal of the spectral bandwidth. When data are not sampled uniformly, the Nyquist theorem no longer applies, and aliasing phenomena become more complex. For samples selected from an evenly spaced grid, signals that are within the nominal bandwidth of the grid can give rise to aliases. The effective bandwidth afforded by a set of nonuniformly sampled evolution times does not necessarily correspond to spacing of the grid from which the samples are selected, but instead depends on the actual distribution of sample times. For conventional uniform sampling there is no distinction between the grid spacing and the sampling interval. For nonuniform sampling, an effective bandwidth can be inferred from the greatest common divisor of the sample times, provided that none of the sample times are irrational. A simple way to increase the effective bandwidth for a set of nonuniformly spaced samples is to randomly select them from an oversampled grid. For a given grid spacing, "bursty" sampling helps to minimize aliasing artifacts. We show that some spectral artifacts arising from nonuniform sampling are aliases, and that increasing the effective bandwidth shifts these artifacts out of the spectral window and improves spectral quality. An advantage of nonuniform sampling is that some of the benefits of oversampling can be realized without incurring experiment time or resolution penalties. We illustrate the improvements that can be obtained with nonuniform sampling in the indirect dimension of a SOFAST-HMQC experiment. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Non-uniform sampling (NUS) has been established as a route to obtaining true sensitivity enhancements when recording indirect dimensions of decaying signals in the same total experimental time as traditional uniform incrementation of the indirect evolution period. Theory and experiments have shown that NUS can yield up to two-fold improvements in the intrinsic signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of each dimension, while even conservative protocols can yield 20-40 % improvements in the intrinsic SNR of NMR data. Applications of biological NMR that can benefit from these improvements are emerging, and in this work we develop some practical aspects of applying NUS nD-NMR to studies that approach the traditional detection limit of nD-NMR spectroscopy. Conditions for obtaining high NUS sensitivity enhancements are considered here in the context of enabling H-1,N-15-HSQC experiments on natural abundance protein samples and H-1,C-13-HMBC experiments on a challenging natural product. Through systematic studies we arrive at more precise guidelines to contrast sensitivity enhancements with reduced line shape constraints, and report an alternative sampling density based on a quarter-wave sinusoidal distribution that returns the highest fidelity we have seen to date in line shapes obtained by maximum entropy processing of non-uniformly sampled data.},

Non-uniform sampling means that data were collectcd for only a subset of all incremented evolution periods, according to a user-specified sampling schedule. When the suite of six 3D experiments was acquired in a uniform fashion for an 11 kDa cytoplasmic domain of a membrane protein at 1.5 mM concentration, a total of 146 h was consumed. With non-uniform sampling, the same experiments were acquired in 32 h and, through subsequent maximum entropy reconstruction, yielded spectra of similar quality to those obtained by conventional Fourier transform of the uniformly acquired data. The experimental time saved with this methodology can significantly accelerate protein structure determination by NMR, particularly when combined with the use of automated assignment software, and enable the study of samples with poor stability at room temperature. Since it is also possible to use the time savings to acquire a greater numbers of scans to increase sensitivity while maintaining high resolution, this methodology will help extend the size limit of proteins accessible to NMR studies, and open the way to studies of samples that suffer from solubility problems.

The potential of these advances is not fully realized in practice, however, since current experimental protocols do not permit sufficient data sampling for optimal resolution in the indirect dimensions. Here we analyze quantitatively how increasing resolution in indirect dimensions affects the S/N ratio and compare this with currently used sampling routines. Optimal resolution would require sampling up to similar to3R(2)(-1), and the S/N reaches a maximum at similar to1.2R(2)(-1). Currently used data acquisition protocols rarely sample beyond 0.4 R-2(-1), and extending evolution times would result in prohibitively long experiments. We show that a general solution to this problem is to use non-uniform sampling, where only a small subset of data points in the indirect sampling space are measured, and possibly different numbers of transients are collected for different evolution times. Coupled with modern methods of spectrum analysis, this strategy delivers substantially improved resolution and/or reduced measuring times compared to uniform sampling, without compromising sensitivity. Higher resolution in the indirect dimensions will facilitate the use of automated assignment programs.},
