The method is widely used to screen active drug mols., simultaneously ranking them in a qual. way. STD NMR is highly successful for a variety of high mol. wt. systems, such as whole viruses, platelets, intact cells, lipopolysaccharide micelles, membrane proteins, recombinant proteins and dispersion pigments. Modifications of STD pulse programs using 13C and 15N nuclei are now used to overcome the signal overlapping that occurs with more complex structures. [on SciFinder(R)]},

   abstract = {A protocol based on saturation transfer difference (STD) NMR spectra was developed to characterize the binding interactions at an atom level, termed group epitope mapping (GEM). As an example we chose the well-studied system of galactose binding to the 120-kDa lectin Ricinus communis agglutinin I (RCA(120)). As ligands we used methyl beta -D-galactoside and a biantennary decasaccharide. Analysis of the saturation transfer effects of methyl beta -D-galactoside showed that the H2, H3, and H4 protons are saturated to the highest degree, giving evidence of their close proximity to protons of the RCA120 lectin. The direct interaction of the lectin with this region of the galactose is in excellent agreement with results obtained from the analysis of the binding specificities of many chemically modified galactose derivatives (Bhattacharyya, L.: Brewer, C. F, Eur. J. Biochem. 1988, 176, 207-212). This new NMR technique can identify the binding epitope of even complex ligands very quickly, which is a great improvement over time-consuming chemical modifications. Efficient GEM benefits from a relatively high off rate of the ligand and a large excess of the ligand over the receptor. Even for a ligand like the biantennary decasaccharide with micromolar binding affinity, the binding epitopes could easily be mapped to the terminal beta -D-Gal-(1-4)-beta -D-GlcNAc (beta -D-GlcNAc = N-acetyl-D-glucosamine) residues located at the nonreducing end of the two carbohydrate chains. The binding contribution of the terminal galactose residue is stronger than those of the penultimate GlcNAc residues. We could show that the GlcNAc residues bind "edge-on" with the region from H2 to H4, making contact with the protein. Analysis of STD NMR experiments performed under competitive conditions proved that the two saccharides studied bind at the same receptor site, thereby ruling out unspecific binding.},

The multi-step NMR assay provides structure-related information while being an integral part of a structure based drug discovery and design program. The fundamental principle of the multi-step NMR assay is to combine distinct 1D and 2D NMR techniques, in such a manner, that the inherent strengths and weakness associated with each technique is complementary to each other in the screen. By taking advantage of the combined strengths of 1D and 2D NMR experiments, it is possible to minimize protein requirements and experiment time and differentiate between nonspecific and stoichiometric binders while being able to verify ligand binding, determine a semi-quantitative dissociation constant, identify the ligand binding site and rapidly determine a protein-ligand co-structure. Furthermore, the quality and physical behavior of the ligand is readily evaluated to determine its appropriateness as a chemical lead. The utility of the multi-step NMR assay is demonstrated with the use of PrgI from Salmonella typhimurium and human serum albumin (HSA) as target proteins.},

The zinc-finger superfamily is massively duplicated in human compared to fly and worm, and occurrence of domains in repeats is more common in metazoa than in single cellular organisms.

Excitation sculpting using arbitrary waveforms and pulsed field gradients, J. Magn. Reson. Ser. A 112 (1995) 275-279] is a highly effective method of water suppression for both biological and small molecule NMR spectroscopy. In excitation sculpting, a double pulsed field gradient spin echo forms the core of the sequence and pairing a low-power soft 180 degrees(-x) pulse with a high-power 180 degrees(x) all resonances except the water are flipped and retained, while the water peak is attenuated. By replacing the hard 180 degrees pulse in the double echo with a new phase-alternating composite pulse, broadband and adjustable excitation of large bandwidths with simultaneous high water suppression is obtained. This "Solvent-Optimized Gradient-Gradient Spectroscopy" (SOGGY) sequence is a reliable workhorse method for a wide range of practical situations in NMR spectroscopy, optimizing both solute sensitivity and water suppression.

Current trends in the pharmaceutical industry have exacerbated these challenges and are contributing to the dramatic decline in productivity obsd. over the last decade. The industrialization of science by forcing the drug discovery process to adhere to assembly-line protocols is imposing unnecessary restrictions, such as short project timelines. Recent advances in NMR are responding to these self-imposed limitations and are providing opportunities to increase the success rate of drug discovery. Objective/method: A review of recent advancements in NMR technol. that have the potential of significantly impacting and benefiting the drug discovery process is presented. These include fast NMR data collection protocols and high-throughput protein structure detn., rapid protein-ligand co-structure detn., lead discovery using fragment-based NMR affinity screens, NMR metabolomics to monitor in vivo efficacy and toxicity for lead compds., and the identification of new therapeutic targets through the functional annotation of proteins by functional annotation screening technol. using NMR. Conclusion: NMR is a crit. component of the drug discovery process, where the versatility of the technique enables it to continually expand and evolve its role. NMR is expected to maintain this growth over the next decade with advancements in automation, speed of structure calcn., in-cell imaging techniques and the expansion of NMR amenable targets.

   abstract = {Background: A recent anal. of protein sequences deposited in the NCBI RefSeq database indicates that ∼8.5 million protein sequences are encoded in prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes, where ∼30% are explicitly annotated as "hypothetical" or "uncharacterized" protein. Our Comparison of Protein Active-Site Structures (CPASS v.2) database and software compares the sequence and structural characteristics of exptl. detd. ligand binding sites to infer a functional relationship in the absence of global sequence or structure similarity. CPASS is an important component of our Functional Annotation Screening Technol. by NMR (FAST-NMR) protocol and has been successfully applied to aid the annotation of a no. of proteins of unknown function. Findings: We report a major upgrade to our CPASS software and database that significantly improves its broad utility. CPASS v.2 is designed with a layered architecture to increase flexibility and portability that also enables job distribution over the Open Science Grid (OSG) to increase speed. Similarly, the CPASS interface was enhanced to provide more user flexibility in submitting a CPASS query. CPASS v.2 now allows for both automatic and manual definition of ligand-binding sites and permits pair-wise, one vs. all, one vs. list, or list vs. list comparisons. Solvent accessible surface area, ligand root-mean square difference, and Cβ distances have been incorporated into the CPASS similarity function to improve the quality of the results. The CPASS database has also been updated. Conclusions: CPASS v.2 is more than an order of magnitude faster than the original implementation, and allows for multiple simultaneous job submissions. Similarly, the CPASS database of ligand-defined binding sites has increased in size by ∼ 38%, dramatically increasing the likelihood of a pos. search result. The modification to the CPASS similarity function is effective in reducing CPASS similarity scores for false positives by ∼30%, while leaving true positives unaffected. Importantly, receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves demonstrate the high correlation between CPASS similarity scores and an accurate functional assignment. As indicated by distribution curves, scores ≥ 30% infer a functional similarity. [on SciFinder(R)]},

By monitoring biologically relevant protein-ligand interactions, NMR can provide a means to validate these discovery leads and to optimize the drug discovery process. NMR-based screens typically use a change in chemical shift or line width to detect a protein-ligand interaction. However, the relatively low throughput of current NMR screens and their high demand on sample requirements generally makes it impractical to collect complete binding curves to measure the affinity for each compound in a large and diverse chemical library. As a result, NMR ligand screens are typically limited to identifying candidates that bind to a protein and do not give any estimate of the binding affinity. To address this issue, a methodology has been developed to rank binding affinities for ligands based on NMR screens that use 1D H-1 NMR line-broadening experiments. This method was demonstrated by using it to estimate the dissociation equilibrium constants for twelve ligands with the protein human serum albumin (HSA). The results were found to give good agreement with previous affinities that have been reported for these same ligands with HSA.},

A satn. transfer difference-NMR-detected screen of a com. available fragment library, followed by biochem. assay, identified several inhibitors of the enzyme ketopantoate reductase. These inhibitors were subsequently revealed to be aggregation-based false positives. Modification of the fragment screen by addn. of detergent in the satn. transfer difference-NMR expts. allowed an assay format to be developed that resulted in the identification of genuine hit mols. suitable for further development.

   abstract = {Data handling in the field of NMR metabolomics has historically been reliant on either in-house mathematical routines or long chains of expensive commercial software. Thus, while the relatively simple biochemical protocols of metabolomics maintain a low barrier to entry, new practitioners of metabolomics experiments are forced to either purchase expensive software packages or craft their own data handling solutions from scratch. This inevitably complicates the standardization and communication of data handling protocols in the field. We report a newly developed open-source platform for complete NMR metabolomics data handling, MVAPACK, and describe its application on an example metabolic fingerprinting data set.},

   abstract = {NMR (NMR) spectroscopy has proven invaluable in the diverse field of chemometrics due to its ability to deliver information-rich spectral datasets of complex mixts. for anal. by techniques such as principal component anal. (PCA). However, NMR datasets present a unique challenge during preprocessing due to differences in phase offsets between individual spectra, thus complicating the correction of random diln. factors that may also occur. We show that simultaneously correcting phase and diln. errors in NMR datasets representative of metabolomics data yields improved cluster quality in PCA scores space, even with significant initial phase errors in the data.
