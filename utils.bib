   abstract = {In many metabolomics studies, NMR spectra are divided into bins of fixed width. This spectral quantification technique, known as uniform binning, is used to reduce the number of variables for pattern recognition techniques and to mitigate effects from variations in peak positions; however, shifts in peaks near the boundaries can cause dramatic quantitative changes in adjacent bins due to non-overlapping boundaries. Here we describe a new Gaussian binning method that incorporates overlapping bins to minimize these effects. A Gaussian kernel weights the signal contribution relative to distance from bin center, and the overlap between bins is controlled by the kernel standard deviation. Sensitivity to peak shift was assessed for a series of test spectra where the offset frequency was incremented in 0.5 Hz steps. For a 4 Hz shift within a bin width of 24 Hz, the error for uniform binning increased by 150%, while the error for Gaussian binning increased by 50%. Further, using a urinary metabolomics data set (from a toxicity study) and principal component analysis (PCA), we showed that the information content in the quantified features was equivalent for Gaussian and uniform binning methods. The separation between groups in the PCA scores plot, measured by the J(2) quality metric, is as good or better for Gaussian binning versus uniform binning. The Gaussian method is shown to be robust in regards to peak shift, while still retaining the information needed by classification and multivariate statistical techniques for NMR-metabolomics data.},

   abstract = {Partial least squares (PLS) was not originally designed as a tool for statistical discrimination. In spite of this, applied scientists routinely use PLS for classification and there is substantial empirical evidence to suggest that it performs well in that role. The interesting question is: why can a procedure that is principally designed for overdetermined regression problems locate and emphasize group structure? Using PLS in this manner has heurestic support owing to the relationship between PLS and canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and the relationship, in turn, between CCA and linear discriminant analysis (LDA). This paper replaces the heuristics with a formal statistical explanation. As a consequence, it will become clear that PLS is to be preferred over PCA when discrimination is the goal and dimension reduction is needed. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.},

   abstract = {Aberrant glucose metabolism is one of the hallmarks of cancer that facilitates cancer cell survival and proliferation. Here, we demonstrate that MUC1, a large, type I transmembrane protein that is overexpressed in several carcinomas including pancreatic adenocarcinoma, modulates cancer cell metabolism to facilitate growth properties of cancer cells. MUC1 occupies the promoter elements of multiple genes directly involved in glucose metabolism and regulates their expression. Furthermore, MUC1 expression enhances glycolytic activity in pancreatic cancer cells. We also demonstrate that MUC1 expression enhances in vivo glucose uptake and expression of genes involved in glucose uptake and metabolism in orthotopic implantation models of pancreatic cancer. The MUC1 cytoplasmic tail is known to activate multiple signaling pathways through its interactions with several transcription factors/coregulators at the promoter elements of various genes. Our results indicate that MUC1 acts as a modulator of the hypoxic response in pancreatic cancer cells by regulating the expression/stability and activity of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha). MUC1 physically interacts with HIF-1alpha and p300 and stabilizes the former at the protein level. By using a ChIP assay, we demonstrate that MUC1 facilitates recruitment of HIF-1alpha and p300 on glycolytic gene promoters in a hypoxia-dependent manner. Also, by metabolomic studies, we demonstrate that MUC1 regulates multiple metabolite intermediates in the glucose and amino acid metabolic pathways. Thus, our studies indicate that MUC1 acts as a master regulator of the metabolic program and facilitates metabolic alterations in the hypoxic environments that help tumor cells survive and proliferate under such conditions.},

   abstract = {Currently, no standard metrics are used to quantify cluster separation in PCA or PLS-DA scores plots for meta-bonomics studies or to determine if cluster separation is statistically significant. lack of such measures makes it virtually impossible to compare independent or inter-laboratory studies and can lead to confusion in the metabonomics literature when authors putatively identify metabolites distinguishing classes of samples based on visual and qualitative inspection of scores plots that exhibit marginal separation. While previous papers have addressed quantification of cluster separation in PCA scores plots, none have advocated routine use of a quantitative measure of separation that is supported by a standard and rigorous assessment of whether or not the cluster separation is statistically significant. Here quantification and statistical significance of separation of group centroids in PCA and PLS-DA scores plots are considered. The Mahalanobis distance is used to quantify the distance between group centroids, and the two-sample Hotelling's T(2) test is computed for the data, related to an F-statistic, and then an F-test is applied to determine if the cluster separation is statistically significant. We demonstrate the value of this approach using four datasets containing various degrees of separation, ranging from groups that had no apparent visual cluster separation to groups that had no visual cluster overlap. Widespread adoption of such concrete metrics to quantify and evaluate the statistical significance of PCA and PLS-DA cluster separation would help standardize reporting of metabonomics data.

   abstract = {Use of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabonomics to search for human disease biomarkers is becoming increasingly common. For many researchers, the ultimate goal is translation from biomarker discovery to clinical application. Studies typically involve investigators from diverse educational and training backgrounds, including physicians, academic researchers, and clinical staff. In evaluating potential biomarkers, clinicians routinely use statistical significance testing language, whereas academicians typically use multivariate statistical analysis techniques that do not perform statistical significance evaluation. In this article, we outline an approach to integrate statistical significance testing with conventional principal components analysis data representation. A decision tree algorithm is introduced to select and apply appropriate statistical tests to loadings plot data, which are then heat map color-coded according to P score, enabling direct visual assessment of statistical significance. A multiple comparisons correction must be applied to determine P scores from which reliable inferences can be made. Knowledge of means and standard deviations of statistically significant buckets enabled computation of effect sizes and study sizes for a given statistical power. Methods were demonstrated using data from a previous study. Integrated metabonomics data assessment methodology should facilitate translation of NMR-based metabonomics discovery of human disease biomarkers to clinical use. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Mycobacterium smegmatis, a non-pathogenic model organism for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, was treated with 12 known drugs and 3 chemical leads identified from a cell-based assay. NMR analysis of drug-induced changes to the M. smegmatis metabolome resulted in distinct clustering patterns correlating with in vivo drug activity. The clustering of novel chemical leads relative to known drugs provides a mean to identify a protein target or predict in vivo activity.},

The question of the similarity or difference between multiple metabolic states then becomes a question of the degree of overlap between their respective data point clusters in principal component (PC) scores space. A qualitative visual inspection of the clustering pattern in PCA scores plots is a common protocol. This article describes the application of tree diagrams and bootstrapping techniques for an improved quantitative analysis of metabolic PCA data clustering. Our PCAtoTree program creates a distance matrix with 100 bootstrap steps that describes the separation of all clusters in a metabolic data set. Using accepted phylogenetic software, the distance matrix resulting from the various metabolic states is organized into a phylogenetic-like tree format, where bootstrap values >= 50 indicate a statistically relevant branch separation. PCAtoTree analysis of two previously published data sets demonstrates the improved resolution of metabolic state differences using tree diagrams. In addition, for metabolomic studies of large numbers of different metabolic states, the tree format provides a better description of similarities and differences between each metabolic state. The approach is also tolerant of sample size variations between different metabolic states. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {PLS-regression (PLSR) is the PLS approach in its simplest, and in chemistry and technology, most used form (two-block predictive PLS). PLSR is a method for relating two data matrices, X and Y, by a linear multivariate model, but goes beyond traditional regression in that it models also the structure of X and Y. PLSR derives its usefulness from its ability to analyze data with many, noisy, collinear, and even incomplete variables in both X and Y. PLSR has the desirable property that the precision of the model parameters improves with the increasing number of relevant variables and observations.
This article reviews PLSR as it has developed to become a standard tool in chemometrics and used in chemistry and engineering. The underlying model and its assumptions are discussed, and commonly used diagnostics are reviewed together with the interpretation of resulting parameters.
Two examples are used as illustrations: First, a Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR)/Quantitative Structure-Property Relationship (QSPR) data set of peptides is used to outline how to develop, interpret and refine a PLSR model. Second, a data set from the manufacturing of recycled paper is analyzed to illustrate time series modelling of process data by means of PLSR and time-lagged X-variables.
