   abstract = {One-dimensional (1)H NMR represents one of the most commonly used analytical techniques in metabolomic studies. The increase in the number of samples analyzed as well as the technical improvements involving instrumentation and spectral acquisition demand increasingly accurate and efficient high-throughput data processing workflows. We present FOCUS, an integrated and innovative methodology that provides a complete data analysis workflow for one-dimensional NMR-based metabolomics. This tool will allow users to easily obtain a NMR peak feature matrix ready for chemometric analysis as well as metabolite identification scores for each peak that greatly simplify the biological interpretation of the results. The algorithm development has been focused on solving the critical difficulties that appear at each data processing step and that can dramatically affect the quality of the results. As well as method integration, simplicity has been one of the main objectives in FOCUS development, requiring very little user input to perform accurate peak alignment, peak picking, and metabolite identification. The new spectral alignment algorithm, RUNAS, allows peak alignment with no need of a reference spectrum, and therefore, it reduces the bias introduced by other alignment approaches. Spectral alignment has been tested against previous methodologies obtaining substantial improvements in the case of moderate or highly unaligned spectra. Metabolite identification has also been significantly improved, using the positional and correlation peak patterns in contrast to a reference metabolite panel. Furthermore, the complete workflow has been tested using NMR data sets from 60 human urine samples and 120 aqueous liver extracts, reaching a successful identification of 42 metabolites from the two data sets. The open-source software implementation of this methodology is available at http://www.urr.cat/FOCUS .},

A key step in this process is the quantification of spectral features, which is commonly accomplished by dividing an NMR spectrum into several hundred integral regions or bins. Binning attempts to minimize effects from variations in peak positions caused by sample pH, ionic strength, and compn., while reducing the dimensionality for multivariate statistical analyses. Herein we develop an improved novel spectral quantification technique, dynamic adaptive binning. With this technique, bin boundaries are detd. by optimizing an objective function using a dynamic programming strategy. The objective function measures the quality of a bin configuration based on the no. of peaks per bin. This technique shows a significant improvement over both traditional uniform binning and other adaptive binning techniques. This improvement is quantified via synthetic validation sets by analyzing an algorithm's ability to create bins that do not contain more than a single peak and that maximize the distance from peak to bin boundary. The validation sets are developed by characterizing the salient distributions in exptl. NMR spectroscopic data. Further, dynamic adaptive binning is applied to a 1H NMR-based expt. to monitor rat urinary metabolites to empirically demonstrate improved spectral quantification. [on SciFinder(R)]},

We demonstrate how class-orthogonal variation can be exploited to augment classification performance in cases where the individual classes exhibit divergence in within-class variation, in analogy with soft independent modelling of class analogy (SIMCA) classification. The prediction results will be largely equivalent to traditional supervised classification using PLS-DA if no such variation is present in the classes. A discriminatory strategy is thus outlined, combining the strengths of PLS-DA and SIMCA classification within the framework of the OPLS-DA method. Furthermore, resampling methods have been employed to generate distributions of predicted classification results and subsequently assess classification belief. This enables utilisation of the class-orthogonal variation in a proper statistical context.

   abstract = {We describe here the implementation of the statistical total correlation spectroscopy (STOCSY) analysis method for aiding the identification of potential biomarker molecules in metabonomic studies based on NMR spectroscopic data. STOCSY takes advantage of the multicollinearity of the intensity variables in a set of spectra (in this case H-1 NMR spectra) to generate a pseudo-two-dimensional NMR spectrum that displays the correlation among the intensities of the various peaks across the whole sample. This method is not limited to the usual connectivities that are deducible from more standard two-dimensional NMR spectroscopic methods, such as TOCSY. Moreover, two or more molecules involved in the same pathway can also present high intermolecular correlations because of biological covariance or can even be anticorrelated. This combination of STOCSY with supervised pattern recognition and particularly orthogonal projection on latent structure-discriminant analysis (O-PLS-DA) offers a new powerful framework for analysis of metabonomic data. In a first step O-PLS-DA extracts the part of NMR spectra related to discrimination. This information is then cross-combined with the STOCSY results to help identify the molecules responsible for the metabolic variation. To illustrate the applicability of the method, it has been applied to 114 NMR spectra of urine from a metabonomic study of a model of insulin resistance based on the administration of a carbohydrate diet to three different mice strains (C57BL/60xjr, BAIB/cOxjr, and 129S6/SvEvOxjr) in which a series of metabolites of biological importance can be conclusively assigned and identified by use of the STOCSY approach.},

   abstract = {In general, applications of metabonomics using biofluid NMR spectroscopic analysis for probing abnormal biochemical profiles in disease or due to toxicity have all relied on the use of chemometric techniques for sample classification. However, the well-known variability of some chemical shifts in H-1 NMR spectra of biofluids due to environmental differences such as pH variation, when coupled with the large number of variables in such spectra, has led to the situation where it is necessary to reduce the size of the spectra or to attempt to align the shifting peaks, to get more robust and interpretable chemometric models. Here, a new approach that avoids this problem is demonstrated and shows that, moreover, inclusion of variable peak position data can be beneficial and can lead to useful biochemical information. The interpretation of chemometric models using combined back-scaled loading plots and variable weights demonstrates that this peak position variation can be handled successfully and also often provides additional information on the physicochemical variations in metabonomic data sets.},

Due to the large spectral size, a standard approach in NMR-based metabolomics implies the division of spectra into equally sized bins, thereby simplifying subsequent data analysis. Yet, disadvantages are the loss of information and the occurrence of artifacts caused by peak shifts. Here, a new binning algorithm, Adaptive Intelligent Binning (AI-Binning), which largely circumvents these problems, is presented. AI-Binning recursively identifies bin edges in existing bins, requires only minimal user input, and avoids the use of arbitrary parameters or reference spectra. The performance of AI-Binning is demonstrated using serum spectra from 40 hypertensive and 40 matched normotensive subjects from the Asklepios study. Hypertension is a major cardiovascular risk factor characterized by a complex biochemistry and, in most cases, an unknown origin. The binning algorithm resulted in an improved classification of hypertensive status compared with that of standard binning and facilitated the identification of relevant metabolites. Moreover, since the occurrence of noise variables is largely avoided, AI-Binned spectra can be unit-variance scaled. This enables the detection of relevant, low-intensity metabolites. These results demonstrate the power of AI-Binning and suggest the involvement of alpha-1 acid glycoproteins and choline biochemistry in hypertension.},

The processing modules themselves maintain and exploit accurate records of data sizes, detection modes, and calibration information in all dimensions, so that schemes can be constructed without the need to explicitly define or anticipate data sizes or storage details of real and imaginary channels during processing. The asynchronous pipeline scheme provides other substantial advantages, including high flexibility, favorable processing speeds, choice of both all-in-memory and disk-bound processing, easy adaptation to different data formats, simpler software development and maintenance, and the ability to distribute processing tasks on multi-CPU computers and computer networks.},

   abstract = {For the analysis of the spectra of complex biofluids, preprocessing methods play a crucial role in rendering the subsequent data analyses more robust and accurate. Normalization is a preprocessing method, which accounts for different dilutions of samples by scaling the spectra to the same virtual overall concentration. In the field of H-1 NMR metabonomics integral normalization, which scales spectra to the same total integral, is the de facto standard. In this work, it is shown that integral normalization is a suboptimal method for normalizing spectra from metabonomic studies. Especially strong metabonomic changes, evident as massive amounts of single metabolites in samples, significantly hamper the integral normalization resulting in incorrectly scaled spectra. The probabilistic quotient normalization is introduced in this work. This method is based on the calculation of a most probable dilution factor by looking at the distribution of the quotients of the amplitudes of a test spectrum by those of a reference spectrum. Simulated spectra, spectra of urine samples from a metabonomic study with cyclosporin-A as the active compound, and spectra of more than 4000 samples of control animals demonstrate that the probabilistic quotient normalization is by far more robust and more accurate than the widespread integral normalization and vector length normalization.},

   abstract = {Correct identification of the origins of herbal medical products is becoming increasingly important in tandem with the growing interest in alternative medicine. However, visual inspection of raw material is still the most widely used method, and newer scientific approaches are needed. To develop a more objective and efficient tool for discriminating herbal origins, particularly Korean and Chinese, we employed a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolomics approach combined with an orthogonal projections to latent structure-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) multivariate analysis. We first analyzed the constituent metabolites of Scutellaria baicalensis through NMR studies. Subsequent holistic data analysis with OPLS-DA yielded a statistical model that could cleanly discriminate between the sample groups even in the presence of large structured noise. An analysis of the statistical total correlation spectroscopy (STOCSY) spectrum identified citric acid and arginine as the key discriminating metabolites for Korean and Chinese samples. As a validation of the discrimination model, we performed blind prediction tests of sample origins using an external test set. Our model correctly predicted the origins of all of the 11 test samples, demonstrating its robustness. We tested the wider applicability of the developed method with three additional herbal medicines from Korea and China and obtained very high prediction accuracy. The solid discriminatory power and statistical validity of our method suggest its general applicability for determining the origins of herbal medicines.},

Several components of wine have been identified and quantified. It is demonstrated how signal alignment procedures were utilized to compensate for pH effects in the NMR spectra prior to the chemometric data modeling. The analysis included region selection by interval partial least squares for regression to reference data-obtained from infrared spectroscopy. Accurate calibration models to the contents of ethanol, glycerol, lactic acid, methanol and malic acid were established. For the more general combined glucose/fructose infrared reference backwards interval partial least squares was introduced for optimal interval selection in calibration. The aim of the paper is to show how pre-processing and region-selection methods can assist in interpretation and quantification of chemical shift multiplets in H-1 NMR spectra of complex biological systems.

A 112 (1995) 275-279] is a highly effective method of water suppression for both biological and small molecule NMR spectroscopy. In excitation sculpting, a double pulsed field gradient spin echo forms the core of the sequence and pairing a low-power soft 180 degrees(-x) pulse with a high-power 180 degrees(x) all resonances except the water are flipped and retained, while the water peak is attenuated. By replacing the hard 180 degrees pulse in the double echo with a new phase-alternating composite pulse, broadband and adjustable excitation of large bandwidths with simultaneous high water suppression is obtained. This "Solvent-Optimized Gradient-Gradient Spectroscopy" (SOGGY) sequence is a reliable workhorse method for a wide range of practical situations in NMR spectroscopy, optimizing both solute sensitivity and water suppression.

However, several chemical and physical factors Can affect the absolute and the relative position of an NMR signal and it is not always possible OF desirable to eliminate these effects a priori. To remove misalignment of NMR signals a posteriori, several algorithms have been proposed in the literature. The icoshift program presented here is an open Source and highly efficient program designed for solving signal alignment problems in metabonomic NMR data analysis. The icoshift algorithm is based on correlation shifting of spectral intervals and employs an FFT engine that aligns all spectra simultaneously. The algorithm is demonstrated to be faster than similar methods found in the literature making full-resolution alignment of large datasets feasible and thus avoiding down-sampling steps such as binning. The algorithm uses missing values as a filling alternative in order to avoid spectral artifacts at the segment boundaries.

We show that the inconsistency of the leave-one-out cross-validation can be rectified by using a leave-n(v)-out cross-validation with n(v), the number of observations reserved for validation, satisfying n(v)/n --> 1 as n --> infinity. This is a somewhat shocking discovery, because n(v)/n --> 1 is totally opposite to the popular leave-one-out recipe in cross-validation. Motivations, justifications, and discussions of some practical aspects of the use of the leave-n(v)-out cross-validation method are provided, and results from a simulation study are presented.},

In this work, an algorithm is proposed to perform an optimized bucketing that yields better results than the conventional bucketing implemented in some commercial software. The improvement proposed here for optimized bucketing deals with the bucket boundaries, which are defined by local minima from average NMR spectrum over all samples. Applicability of the new algorithm, named OBA (optimized bucketing algorithm), is demonstrated for real data sets in comparison to other alignment approaches and conventional bucketing.

Often the effectiveness of such approaches is impeded by experimental and instrument induced variations in the position, phase, and line width of the spectral peaks. Although characterizing the cause and magnitude of these fluctuations could be important in its own right (pH-induced NMR chemical shift changes, for example) in general they obscure the process of pattern discovery. One major area of application is the use of large databases of H-1 NMR spectra of biofluids such as urine for investigating perturbations in metabolic profiles caused by drugs or disease, a process now termed metabonomics. Frequency shifts of individual peaks are the dominant source of such unwanted variations in this type of data. In this paper, an automatic procedure for aligning the individual peaks in the data set is described and evaluated. The proposed method will be vital for the efficient and automatic analysis of large metabonomic data sets and should also be applicable to other types of data. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

   abstract = {The 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra of biological samples, such as blood plasma and tissues, are information rich but data complex owing to superposition of the resonances from a multitude of different chemical entities in multiple-phase compartments, hampering detection and subsequent resonance assignments. To overcome these problems, several spectral-editing NMR experiments are described here, combining spin-relaxation filters (based on T(1), T(rho), and T(2)) with both one-dimensional and two-dimensional (2D) NMR spectroscopy. These techniques enable the separation of NMR resonances based on their relaxation times and allow simplification of the complex spectra. In this paper, the approach is exemplified using a control human blood plasma, which is a complex mixture of proteins, lipoproteins, and small-molecule metabolites. In the case of T(1p)- and T(2)-edited 2D NMR experiments, a "flip-back" pulse was introduced after the relaxation editing to make the phase cycling of the "relaxation filter" and the 2D NMR part independent, thus enabling easy implementation of the phase-sensitive 2D NMR experiments. These methods also permit much higher receiver gains to be used to reduce digitization error, in particular, for the small resonances, which are sometimes vitally important for metabonomics studies. Both pulse sequences and experimental results are discussed for T(1)-, T(1rho)-, and T(2)-filtered COSY, T(2)-filtered phase-sensitive DQF-COSY, and T(1), T(1rho)-, and T(2)-filtered TOCSY NMR.

Under ideal conditions, H-1-NMR peak intensities are directly proportional to metabolite concentrations and thus are useful for class prediction and biomarker discovery. However, many biological, experimental and instrumental variables can affect absolute NMR peak intensities. Normalizing or scaling data to minimize the influence of these variables is a critical step in producing robust, reproducible analyses. Traditionally, analyses of biological fluids have relied on the total spectral area [constant sum (CS)] to normalize individual intensities. This approach can introduce considerable inter-sample variance as changes in any individual metabolite will affect the scaling of all of the observed intensities. To reduce normalization-related variance, we have developed a histogram matching (HM) approach adapted from the field of image processing. We validate our approach using mixtures of synthetic compounds that mimic a biological extract and apply the method to an analysis of urine from rats treated with ethionine. We show that HM is a robust method for normalizing H-1-NMR data and propose it as an alternative to the traditional CS method.},

O-PLS removes variation from X (descriptor variables) that is not correlated to Y (property variables, e.g. yield, cost or toxicity). In mathematical terms this is equivalent to removing systematic variation in X that is orthogonal to Y. In an earlier paper, Wold et al. (Chemometrics Intell, Lab. Syst. 1998; 44:175-185) described orthogonal signal correction (OSC). In this paper a method with the same objective but with different means is described. The proposed O-PLS method analyzes the variation explained in each PLS component. The non-correlated systematic variation in X is removed, making interpretation of the resulting PLS model easier and with the additional benefit that the non-correlated variation itself can be analyzed further. As an example, near-infrared (NIR) reflectance spectra of wood chips were analyzed. Applying O-PLS resulted in reduced model complexity with preserved prediction ability, effective removal of noncorrelated variation in X and, not least, improved interpretational ability of both correlated and noncorrelated variation in the NIR spectra.

   abstract = {Background: Extracting relevant biological information from large data sets is a major challenge in functional genomics research. Different aspects of the data hamper their biological interpretation. For instance, 5000-fold differences in concentration for different metabolites are present in a metabolomics data set, while these differences are not proportional to the biological relevance of these metabolites. However, data analysis methods are not able to make this distinction. Data pretreatment methods can correct for aspects that hinder the biological interpretation of metabolomics data sets by emphasizing the biological information in the data set and thus improving their biological interpretability.
Results: Different data pretreatment methods, i.e. centering, autoscaling, pareto scaling, range scaling, vast scaling, log transformation, and power transformation, were tested on a real-life metabolomics data set. They were found to greatly affect the outcome of the data analysis and thus the rank of the, from a biological point of view, most important metabolites. Furthermore, the stability of the rank, the influence of technical errors on data analysis, and the preference of data analysis methods for selecting highly abundant metabolites were affected by the data pretreatment method used prior to data analysis.
Conclusion: Different pretreatment methods emphasize different aspects of the data and each pretreatment method has its own merits and drawbacks. The choice for a pretreatment method depends on the biological question to be answered, the properties of the data set and the data analysis method selected. For the explorative analysis of the validation data set used in this study, autoscaling and range scaling performed better than the other pretreatment methods. That is, range scaling and autoscaling were able to remove the dependence of the rank of the metabolites on the average concentration and the magnitude of the fold changes and showed biologically sensible results after PCA (principal component analysis).
In conclusion, selecting a proper data pretreatment method is an essential step in the analysis of metabolomics data and greatly affects the metabolites that are identified to be the most important.},

   abstract = {The discovery of new anti-inflammatory drugs is often based on an interaction with a specific target, although other pathways often play a primary or secondary role. Anti-inflammatory drugs can be categorized into classes, based on their mechanism of action. In this article we investigate the possibility to characterize novel anti-inflammatory compounds by three holistic methods. For this purpose, we make use of macrophage-like U937 cells which are stimulated with LPS in the absence or presence of an anti-inflammatory compound. Using micro-arrays, 2-D gel electrophoresis and a LC-MS method for lipids the effects on the transcriptome, proteome and metabolome of the exposed cells is investigated. The expression patterns are subsequently analyzed using in-house developed pattern recognition tools. Using the methods described above, we have examined the effects of six anti-inflammatory compounds. Our results demonstrate that different classes of anti-inflammatory compounds show distinct and characteristic mRNA, protein, and lipid expression patterns, which can be used to categorise known molecules and to discover and classify new leads. The potential of our approach is illustrated by the analysis of several beta (2)-adrenergic agonists (beta(2)-agonists). In addition to their primary pharmacological target, beta(2)-agonists posses certain anti-inflammatory properties. We were able to show that zilpaterol, a poorly characterized beta(2)-agonist, gives rise to an almost identical expression pattern as the beta(2)-agonists clenbuterol and salbutamol. Furthermore we have identified specific mRNA, protein and lipid markers for the anti-inflammatory compounds investigated in this study. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {The high spectral congestion typically observed in one-dimensional (I D) H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra of tissue extracts and biofluids limits the metabolic information that can be extracted. This study evaluates the application of two-dimensional J-resolved (JRES) spectroscopy for metabolomics, which can provide proton-decoupled projected ID spectra (p-JRES). This approach is illustrated by an investigation of embryogenesis in Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes), an established fish model for developmental toxicology. When combined with optimized spectral pre-processing,(2) including a 0.005-ppm bin width for data segmentation and a logarithmic transformation, the reduced congestion in the p-JRES spectra increases the likelihood that a specific metabolite can be accurately integrated and thus increases the extractable information content of the spectra. Principal components analysis of the p-JRES spectra reveals the concept of a developmental trajectory that summarizes the changes in the NMR-visible metabolome throughout medaka embryogenesis. Advantages and potential disadvantages of the p-JRES approach are discussed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Background: Spectral processing and post-experimental data analysis are the major tasks in NMR-based metabonomics studies. While there are commercial and free licensed software tools available to assist these tasks, researchers usually have to use multiple software packages for their studies because software packages generally focus on specific tasks. It would be beneficial to have a highly integrated platform, in which these tasks can be completed within one package. Moreover, with open source architecture, newly proposed algorithms or methods for spectral processing and data analysis can be implemented much more easily and accessed freely by the public.
Results: In this paper, we report an open source software tool, Automics, which is specifically designed for NMR-based metabonomics studies. Automics is a highly integrated platform that provides functions covering almost all the stages of NMR-based metabonomics studies. Automics provides high throughput automatic modules with most recently proposed algorithms and powerful manual modules for 1D NMR spectral processing. In addition to spectral processing functions, powerful features for data organization, data pre-processing, and data analysis have been implemented. Nine statistical methods can be applied to analyses including: feature selection (Fisher's criterion), data reduction (PCA, LDA, ULDA), unsupervised clustering (K-Mean) and supervised regression and classification (PLS/PLS-DA, KNN, SIMCA, SVM). Moreover, Automics has a user-friendly graphical interface for visualizing NMR spectra and data analysis results. The functional ability of Automics is demonstrated with an analysis of a type 2 diabetes metabolic profile.
Conclusion: Automics facilitates high throughput 1D NMR spectral processing and high dimensional data analysis for NMR-based metabonomics applications. Using Automics, users can complete spectral processing and data analysis within one software package in most cases. Moreover, with its open source architecture, interested},

   abstract = {In the present paper the concept of orthogonal signal correction (OSC) as a spectral preprocessing method is discussed and a number of OSC algorithms that have appeared are compared from a theoretical viewpoint. Since all of these algorithms had some problems concerning the orthogonality towards Y, non-optimal amount of variance removed from X, or a non-attainable solution, a new direct OSC algorithm (DOSC) is introduced. DOSC was originally developed as a direct method solely based on least squares steps that h;td none of the problems mentioned above. The first practical results with the new method, however, were not encouraging due to the complete orthogonality constraint. If this orthogonality constraint is loosened, the method improves considerably and simplifies the calibration model for the prediction of Y. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Due to the low number of individuals compared to the large number of variables, this is not an easy task. PLSDA is one of the data analysis methods used for the classification. Unfortunately this method eagerly overfits the data and rigorous validation is necessary. The validation however is far from straightforward. Is this paper we will discuss a strategy based on cross model validation and permutation testing to validate the classification models. It is also shown that too optimistic results are obtained when the validation is not done properly. Furthermore, we advocate against the use of PLSDA score plots for inference of class differences.},

   abstract = {Metabolomics studies generate increasingly complex data tables, which are hard to summarize and visualize without appropriate tools. The use of chemometrics tools, e.g., principal component analysis (PCA), partial least-squares to latent structures (PLS), and orthogonal PLS (OPLS), is therefore of great importance as these include efficient, validated, and robust methods for modeling information-rich chemical and biological data. Here the S-plot is proposed as a tool for visualization and interpretation of multivariate classification models, e.g., OPLS discriminate analysis, having two or more classes. The S-plot visualizes both the covariance and correlation between the metabolites and the modeled class designation. Thereby the S-plot helps identifying statistically significant and potentially biochemically significant metabolites, based both on contributions to the model and their reliability. An extension of the S-plot, the SUS-plot (shared and unique structure), is applied to compare the outcome of multiple classification models compared to a common reference, e.g., control. The used example is a gas chromatography coupled mass spectroscopy based metabolomics study in plant biology where two different transgenic poplar lines are compared to wild type. By using OPLS, an improved visualization and discrimination of interesting metabolites could be demonstrated.},

   abstract = {PLS-regression (PLSR) is the PLS approach in its simplest, and in chemistry and technology, most used form (two-block predictive PLS). PLSR is a method for relating two data matrices, X and Y, by a linear multivariate model, but goes beyond traditional regression in that it models also the structure of X and Y. PLSR derives its usefulness from its ability to analyze data with many, noisy, collinear, and even incomplete variables in both X and Y. PLSR has the desirable property that the precision of the model parameters improves with the increasing number of relevant variables and observations.
This article reviews PLSR as it has developed to become a standard tool in chemometrics and used in chemistry and engineering. The underlying model and its assumptions are discussed, and commonly used diagnostics are reviewed together with the interpretation of resulting parameters.
Two examples are used as illustrations: First, a Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR)/Quantitative Structure-Property Relationship (QSPR) data set of peptides is used to outline how to develop, interpret and refine a PLSR model. Second, a data set from the manufacturing of recycled paper is analyzed to illustrate time series modelling of process data by means of PLSR and time-lagged X-variables.

   abstract = {First released in 2009, MetaboAnalyst (www.metaboanalyst.ca) was a relatively simple web server designed to facilitate metabolomic data processing and statistical analysis. With continuing advances in metabolomics along with constant user feedback, it became clear that a substantial upgrade to the original server was necessary. MetaboAnalyst 2.0, which is the successor to MetaboAnalyst, represents just such an upgrade. MetaboAnalyst 2.0 now contains dozens of new features and functions including new procedures for data filtering, data editing and data normalization. It also supports multi-group data analysis, two-factor analysis as well as time-series data analysis. These new functions have also been supplemented with: (i) a quality-control module that allows users to evaluate their data quality before conducting any analysis, (ii) a functional enrichment analysis module that allows users to identify biologically meaningful patterns using metabolite set enrichment analysis and (iii) a metabolic pathway analysis module that allows users to perform pathway analysis and visualization for 15 different model organisms. In developing MetaboAnalyst 2.0 we have also substantially improved its graphical presentation tools. All images are now generated using anti-aliasing and are available over a range of resolutions, sizes and formats (PNG, TIFF, PDF, PostScript, or SVG). To improve its performance, MetaboAnalyst 2.0 is now hosted on a much more powerful server with substantially modified code to take advantage the server's multi-core CPUs for computationally intensive tasks. MetaboAnalyst 2.0 also maintains a collection of 50 or more FAQs and more than a dozen tutorials compiled from user queries and requests. A downloadable version of MetaboAnalyst 2.0, along detailed instructions for local installation is now available as well.},
