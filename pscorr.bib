The optimal zero-order and first-order phase corrections for a NMR spectrum are determined by minimizing entropy. The objective function is constructed using a Shannon-type information entropy measure. Entropy is defined as the normalized derivative of the NMR spectral data. The algorithm has been successfully applied to experimental H-1 NMR spectra. The results of automatic phase correction are found to be comparable to, or perhaps better than, manual phase correction. The advantages of this automatic phase correction algorithm include its simple mathematical basis and the straightforward, reproducible, and efficient optimization procedure.

   abstract = {A maximum likelihood (ML)-based approach has been established for the direct extraction of NMR parameters (e.g., frequency, amplitude, phase, and decay rate) simultaneously from all dimensions of a D-dimensional NMR spectrum. The approach, referred to here as HTFD-ML (hybrid time frequency domain maximum likelihood), constructs a time-domain model composed of a sum of exponentially-decaying sinusoidal signals. The apodized Fourier transform of this time-domain signal is a model spectrum that represents the 'best fit' to the equivalent frequency-domain data spectrum. The desired amplitude and frequency parameters can be extracted directly from the signal model constructed by the HTFD-ML algorithm. The HTFD-ML approach presented here, as embodied in the software package CHIFIT, is designed to meet the challenges posed by model fitting of D-dimensional NMR data sets, where each consists of many data points (10(8) is not uncommon) encoding information about numerous signals (up to 10(5) for a protein of moderate size) that exhibit spectral overlap. The suitability of the approach is demonstrated by its application to the concerted analysis of a series of ten 2D H-1-N-15 HSQC experiments measuring N-15 T-1 relaxation. In addition to demonstrating the practicality of performing maximum likelihood analysis on large, multidimensional NMR spectra, the results demonstrate that this parametric model-fitting approach provides more accurate amplitude and frequency estimates than those obtained from conventional peak-based analysis of the FT spectrum. The improved performance of the model fitting approach derives from its ability to take into account the simultaneous contributions of all signals in a crowded spectral region (deconvolution) as well as to incorporate prior knowledge in constructing models to fit the data.},

A number of studies have presented various data manipulation approaches, some suggesting an optimum method. In metabonomics, data are usually presented as a table where each row relates to a given sample or analytical experiment and each column corresponds to a single measurement in that experiment, typically individual spectral peak intensities or metabolite concentrations. Here we suggest definitions for and discuss the operations usually termed normalization (a table row operation) and scaling (a table column operation) and demonstrate their need in H-1 NMR spectroscopic data sets derived from urine. The problems associated with "binned" data (i.e., values integrated over discrete spectral regions) are also discussed, and the particular biological context problems of analytical data on urine are highlighted. It is shown that care must be exercised in calculation of correlation coefficients for data sets where normalization to a constant sum is used. Analogous considerations will be needed for other biofluids, other analytical approaches (e.g., HPLC-MS), and indeed for other "omics" techniques (i.e., transcriptomics or proteomics) and for integrated studies with "fused" data sets. It is concluded that data preprocessing is context dependent and there can be no single method for general use.},

In an NMRPipe processing scheme, a stream of spectral data flows through a pipeline of processing programs, each of which performs one component of the overall scheme, such as Fourier transformation or linear prediction. Complete multidimensional processing schemes are constructed as simple UNIX shell scripts. The processing modules themselves maintain and exploit accurate records of data sizes, detection modes, and calibration information in all dimensions, so that schemes can be constructed without the need to explicitly define or anticipate data sizes or storage details of real and imaginary channels during processing. The asynchronous pipeline scheme provides other substantial advantages, including high flexibility, favorable processing speeds, choice of both all-in-memory and disk-bound processing, easy adaptation to different data formats, simpler software development and maintenance, and the ability to distribute processing tasks on multi-CPU computers and computer networks.},

   abstract = {For the analysis of the spectra of complex biofluids, preprocessing methods play a crucial role in rendering the subsequent data analyses more robust and accurate. Normalization is a preprocessing method, which accounts for different dilutions of samples by scaling the spectra to the same virtual overall concentration. In the field of H-1 NMR metabonomics integral normalization, which scales spectra to the same total integral, is the de facto standard. In this work, it is shown that integral normalization is a suboptimal method for normalizing spectra from metabonomic studies. Especially strong metabonomic changes, evident as massive amounts of single metabolites in samples, significantly hamper the integral normalization resulting in incorrectly scaled spectra. The probabilistic quotient normalization is introduced in this work. This method is based on the calculation of a most probable dilution factor by looking at the distribution of the quotients of the amplitudes of a test spectrum by those of a reference spectrum. Simulated spectra, spectra of urine samples from a metabonomic study with cyclosporin-A as the active compound, and spectra of more than 4000 samples of control animals demonstrate that the probabilistic quotient normalization is by far more robust and more accurate than the widespread integral normalization and vector length normalization.},

NMR analysis of drug-induced changes to the M. smegmatis metabolome resulted in distinct clustering patterns correlating with in vivo drug activity. The clustering of novel chemical leads relative to known drugs provides a mean to identify a protein target or predict in vivo activity.},

The goal is to reduce the spectrum to a tabular line list of peak positions, widths, amplitudes, and phases, and to have this line list be of high fidelity. In this context "high fidelity" means that each true NMR transition is represented by a single entry, with no spurious entries and no missed peaks. A high fidelity line list allows the measurement of chemical shifts and coupling constants with good accuracy and precision and is the ultimate in data compression. There are two parts to the problem. The first is to overcome common imperfections: the non-Lorentzian lineshapes that can arise whenever the magnetic field inhomogeneity is less than perfect, and nonzero time delays that cause frequency-dependent phase errors. The second is to fit the spectral features to a model of Lorentzian lines. We use the recently developed filter diagonalization method (FDM) to accomplish the reference deconvolution, the phase correction, and the fitting, and show good progress toward the goal of obtaining a high fidelity line list.

Under ideal conditions, H-1-NMR peak intensities are directly proportional to metabolite concentrations and thus are useful for class prediction and biomarker discovery. However, many biological, experimental and instrumental variables can affect absolute NMR peak intensities. Normalizing or scaling data to minimize the influence of these variables is a critical step in producing robust, reproducible analyses. Traditionally, analyses of biological fluids have relied on the total spectral area [constant sum (CS)] to normalize individual intensities. This approach can introduce considerable inter-sample variance as changes in any individual metabolite will affect the scaling of all of the observed intensities. To reduce normalization-related variance, we have developed a histogram matching (HM) approach adapted from the field of image processing. We validate our approach using mixtures of synthetic compounds that mimic a biological extract and apply the method to an analysis of urine from rats treated with ethionine. We show that HM is a robust method for normalizing H-1-NMR data and propose it as an alternative to the traditional CS method.},

PLSR is a method for relating two data matrices, X and Y, by a linear multivariate model, but goes beyond traditional regression in that it models also the structure of X and Y. PLSR derives its usefulness from its ability to analyze data with many, noisy, collinear, and even incomplete variables in both X and Y. PLSR has the desirable property that the precision of the model parameters improves with the increasing number of relevant variables and observations.
This article reviews PLSR as it has developed to become a standard tool in chemometrics and used in chemistry and engineering. The underlying model and its assumptions are discussed, and commonly used diagnostics are reviewed together with the interpretation of resulting parameters.
Two examples are used as illustrations: First, a Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR)/Quantitative Structure-Property Relationship (QSPR) data set of peptides is used to outline how to develop, interpret and refine a PLSR model. Second, a data set from the manufacturing of recycled paper is analyzed to illustrate time series modelling of process data by means of PLSR and time-lagged X-variables.
