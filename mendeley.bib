abstract = {The comprehensive description of Multidimensional Fourier Transform applied to arbitrary sampled NMR data is presented. Lineshapes and signal-to-artifact ratio are discussed in detail with regard to time domain sampling scheme and applied data weighting. It is demonstrated that transformation method with simple summation instead of numerical integration is most useful for significantly undersampled experiments. Additionally, the optimized random sampling schedule which enables significant improvement of obtained spectra is proposed. The new procedure of cleaning spectra is presented, it is based on predictability of artifacts pattern when sampling scheme and amplitude of intense signals are known. The results enable observation of high dynamic range spectra as for example heteronuclear edited NOESY. We show the application of new approach to the 3D 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC spectrum acquired for 13C, 15N labeled ubiquitin sample with random time domain sampling. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The method maintains and updates a non-parametric model of the observed data, from which the KDE can be calculated. We propose an online bandwidth estimation approach and a compression/revitalization scheme which maintains the KDE's complexity low. We compare the proposed online KDE to the state-of-the-art approaches on examples of estimating stationary and non-stationary distributions, and on examples of classification. The results show that the online KDE outperforms or achieves a comparable performance to the state-of-the-art and produces models with a significantly lower complexity while allowing online adaptation. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {It is proposed to convert nuclear Overhauser effects (NOEs) into relatively precise distances for detailed structural studies of proteins. To this purpose, it is demonstrated that the measurement of NOE buildups between amide protons in perdeuterated human ubiquitin using a designed (15)N-resolved HMQC-NOESY experiment enables the determination of (1)H(N)-(1)H(N) distances up to 5 A with high accuracy and precision. These NOE-derived distances have an experimental random error of approximately 0.07 A, which is smaller than the pairwise rmsd (root-mean-square deviation) of 0.24 A obtained with corresponding distances extracted from either an NMR or an X-ray structure (pdb codes: 1D3Z and 1UBQ), and also smaller than the pairwise rmsd between distances from X-ray and NMR structures (0.15 A). Because the NOE contains both structural and dynamical information, a comparison between the 3D structures and NOE-derived distances may also give insights into through-space dynamics. It appears that the extraction of motional information from NOEs by comparison to the X-ray structure or the NMR structure is challenging because the motion may be masked by the quality of the structures. Nonetheless, a detailed analysis thereof suggests motions between beta-strands and large complex motions in the alpha-helix of ubiquitin. The NOE-derived motions are, however, of smaller amplitude and possibly of a different character than those present in a 20 ns molecular dynamic simulation of ubiquitin in water using the GROMOS force field. Furthermore, a recently published set of structures representing the conformational distribution over time scales up to milliseconds (pdb: 2K39) does not satisfy the NOEs better than the single X-ray structure. Hence, the measurement of possibly thousands of exact NOEs throughout the protein may serve as an excellent probe toward a correct representation of both structure and dynamics of proteins.},

abstract = {Characterization of the mechanisms by which proteins fold into their native conformations is important not only for protein structure prediction and design but also because protein misfolding intermediates may play critical roles in fibril formation that are commonplace in neurodegenerative disorders. In practice, the study of folding pathways is complicated by the fact that for the most part intermediates are low-populated and short-lived so that biophysical studies are difficult. Due to recent methodological advances, relaxation dispersion NMR spectroscopy has emerged as a particularly powerful tool to obtain high-resolution structural information about protein folding events on the millisecond timescale. Applications of the methodology to study the folding of SH3 domains have shown that folding proceeds via previously undetected on-pathway intermediates, sometimes stabilized by nonnative long-range interactions. The relaxation dispersion approach provides a detailed kinetic and thermodynamic description of the folding process as well as the promise of obtaining an atomic level structural description of intermediate states. We review the concerted application of a variety of recently developed NMR relaxation dispersion experiments to obtain a "high-resolution" picture of the folding pathway of the A39V/N53P/V55L Fyn SH3 domain. © 2009 by the Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to demonstrate a simple and fast method for solving the time-dependent Bloch equations. First, the time-dependent Bloch equations were reduced to a homogeneous linear differential equation, and then a simple equation was derived to solve it using a matrix operation. The validity of this method was investigated by comparing with the analytical solutions in the case of constant radiofrequency irradiation. There was a good agreement between them, indicating the validity of this method. As a further example, this method was applied to the time-dependent Bloch equations in the two-pool exchange model for chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) or amide proton transfer (APT) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and the Z-spectra and asymmetry spectra were calculated from their solutions. They were also calculated using the fourth/fifth-order Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg (RKF) method for comparison. There was also a good agreement between them, and this method was much faster than the RKF method. In conclusion, this method will be useful for analyzing the complex CEST or APT contrast mechanism and/or investigating the optimal conditions for CEST or APT MRI. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

These experiments identify binding events either by looking at the resonance signals of the ligand or the protein. Ideally, both techniques together deliver a complete picture of ligand binding to a receptor. The approaches discussed in this review allow screening of compound libraries as well as a detailed identification of the groups involved in the binding events. Also, characterization of the binding strength and kinetics is possible, competitive binding as well as allosteric effects can be identified, and it has even been possible to identify ligand binding to intact viruses and membrane-bound proteins.},

abstract = {A modified Lorentzian distribution function is used to model peaks in two-dimensional (2D) 1H–13C heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra. The model fit is used to determine accurate chemical shifts from genuine signals in complex metabolite mixtures such as blood. The algorithm can be used to extract features from a set of spectra from different samples for exploratory metabolomics. First a reference spectrum is created in which the peak intensities are given by the median value over all samples at each point in the 2D spectra so that 1H–13C correlations in any spectra are accounted for. The mathematical model provides a footprint for each peak in the reference spectrum, which can be used to bin the 1H–13C correlations in each HSQC spectrum. The binned intensities are then used as variables in multivariate analyses and those found to be discriminatory are rapidly identified by cross referencing the chemical shifts of the bins with a database of 13C and 1H chemical shift correlations from known metabolites},

Similarly, optimization of the MS inlet and interface can lead to increased measurement sensitivity.

abstract = {In regular crystals, the width of the absorption lines arising from the magnetic moment of the electron or nucleus is caused primarily by the interaction between the magnetic dipoles. It is prohibitively difficult to determine the precise shape of the absorption line theoretically, but the invariance of the diagonal sum in quantum mechanics permits the calculation of the second moment of the frequency deviation, and hence the r.m.s. line breadth. The latter agrees excellently with the observations of Pake and Purcell on the magnetic absorption of the F nucleus in CaF2, both in absolute magnitude, and in the dependence on the direction between the magnetic field and the principal cubic axes. The fourth moment was also computed to examine how good an approximation is the conventional assumption of a Gaussian shape. As long as no exchange is present (the nuclear case) the Gaussian model is moderately good. For the 100 direction in a cubic crystal, the theoretical ratio of root mean fourth to root mean square breadth is 1.25. Pake and Purcell's measurements yield 1.24. A Gaussian model would require 1.32. The theory is extended to include crystals with two kinds of spin moments (two types of nuclei, or simultaneous nuclear and electronic spin). Coupling between unlike moments is less effective (by a factor ⅔ in the r.m.s. width) than that between like in broadening the lines.In the paramagnetic absorption caused by electronic spin, it is imperative to include the effect of exchange coupling. This interaction does not contribute to the second moment, but greatly increases the fourth. As a result, the lines are peaked much more sharply than one would compute from the second moment with the Gaussian model for line shape. This "exchange narrowing" explains why microwave paramagnetic absorption lines are much narrower than one first conjectures from the amount of dipolar coupling.The theoretical calculations are given in Sections II-IV. The final sections V-VI give the comparison with the experiments of Pake and Purcell, and with the model of Bloembergen, Purcell, and Pound, for r-f absorption in liquids.},

The observed dependence is closely mimicked in spectra calculated for a series of corresponding model polypeptides. The simulated spectra were calculated in a skeletal approximation for ensembles of conformationally disordered chains. As the chain length of the conformationally disordered polypeptides increases, the observed isotropic spectra rapidly approach the spectrum of the infinitely long disordered chain. Convergence is nearly complete at the tripeptide for both the zwitterion and the cation. The stimulated spectra behave in essentially the same way. Convergence to the spectrum of the infinitely long chain is much more rapid for the conformationally disordered polyglycines than for the ordered polyglycines because of the mode localization that results from disorder. In the low-frequency region the bands in the calculated spectra have frequencies that are systematically dependent on chain length. These bands are related to the longitudinal acoustic modes of the ordered chain.},

Quantitative measures of conformational entropy are necessary for an understanding of its role but have been difficult to obtain. An empirical method that utilizes changes in conformational dynamics as a proxy for changes in conformational entropy has recently been introduced. Here we probe the microscopic origins of the link between conformational dynamics and conformational entropy using molecular dynamics simulations. Simulation of seven proteins gave an excellent correlation with measures of side-chain motion derived from NMR relaxation. The simulations show that the motion of methyl-bearing side chains are sufficiently coupled to that of other side chains to serve as excellent reporters of the overall side-chain conformational entropy. These results tend to validate the use of experimentally accessible measures of methyl motion--the NMR-derived generalized order parameters--as a proxy from which to derive changes in protein conformational entropy.},

abstract = {Despite significant progress in recent years, protein structure prediction maintains its status as one of the prime unsolved problems in computational biology. One of the key remaining challenges is an efficient probabilistic exploration of the structural space that correctly reflects the relative conformational stabilities. Here, we present a fully probabilistic, continuous model of local protein structure in atomic detail. The generative model makes efficient conformational sampling possible and provides a framework for the rigorous analysis of local sequence-structure correlations in the native state. Our method represents a significant theoretical and practical improvement over the widely used fragment assembly technique by avoiding the drawbacks associated with a discrete and nonprobabilistic approach.},

The vibrational relaxation rates have been estimated from the isotropic component of Raman band in different solvents. The rate is shown to be dependent on several macroscopic as well as microscopic properties of the solute-solvent system and intermolecular interactions.

abstract = {The Interval Correlation Optimised Shifting algorithm (icoshift) has recently been introduced for the alignment of nuclear magnetic resonance spectra. The method is based on an insertion/deletion model to shift intervals of spectra/chromatograms and relies on an efficient Fast Fourier Transform based computation core that allows the alignment of large data sets in a few seconds on a standard personal computer. The potential of this programme for the alignment of chromatographic data is outlined with focus on the model used for the correction function. The efficacy of the algorithm is demonstrated on a chromatographic data set with 45 chromatograms of 64,000 data points. Computation time is significantly reduced compared to the Correlation Optimised Warping (COW) algorithm, which is widely used for the alignment of chromatographic signals. Moreover, icoshift proved to perform better than COW in terms of quality of the alignment (viz. of simplicity and peak factor), but without the need for computationally expensive optimisations of the warping meta-parameters required by COW. Principal component analysis (PCA) is used to show how a significant reduction on data complexity was achieved, improving the ability to highlight chemical differences amongst the samples. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Although the chemical shift anisotropy relaxation mechanism dominates at highmagnetic field strength, the contributions of the dipole-dipole interactions and thecross-correlation between these two relaxation mechanisms have also been considered.Information about internal motions has been extracted from the relaxation data using themodel-free approach of Lipari and Szabo in order to determine order parameters (S2) andeffective internal correlation times (taui). Using a relatively simple relation between themeasured relaxation rates and the spectral density function, an analytical expression for themicrodynamical parameters in dependence of T1 and T2 has been derived. The spectraldensity mapping technique has been applied in order to study the behaviour of the carbonylcarbon resonances in more detail.},

The idea behind the support-vector network was previously implemented for the restricted case where the training data can be separated without errors. We here extend this result to non-separable training data. High generalization ability of support-vector networks utilizing polynomial input transformations is demon- strated.

Moreover it is shown that the constants can be calculated explicitly in special cases (i.e. for compact operators). Furthermore, the techniques also can be used to establish linear convergence for related methods such as the iterative thresholding algorithm for joint sparsity and the accelerated gradient projection method.},

abstract = {Dimensionality reduction and feature subset selection are two techniques for reducing the attribute space of a feature set, which is an important component of both supervised and unsupervised classification or regression problems. While in feature subset selection a subset of the original attributes is extracted, dimensionality reduction in general produces linear combinations of the original attribute set. In this paper we investigate the relationship between several attribute space reduction techniques and the resulting classification accuracy for two very different application areas. On the one hand, we consider e-mail filtering, where the feature space contains various properties of e-mail messages, and on the other hand, we consider drug discovery prob- lems, where quantitative representations of molecular structures are encoded in terms of information-preserving descriptor values. Subsets of the original attributes constructed by filter and wrapper techniques as well as subsets of linear combinations of the original attributes constructed by three different variants of the principle component analysis (PCA) are compared in terms of the classifica- tion performance achieved with various machine learning algorithms as well as in terms of runtime performance. We successively reduce the size of the attribute sets and investigate the changes in the classification results. Moreover, we explore the relationship between the variance captured in the linear combinations within PCA and the resulting classification accuracy. The results show that the classification accuracy based on PCA is highly sensitive to the type of data and that the variance captured the principal components is not necessarily a vital indicator for the classification performance.},

abstract = {The need to reduce data acquisition times of multidimensional NMR experiments has fostered considerable interest in novel data acquisition schemes. A recurring theme is that of reduced dimensionality experiments, in which time evolutions in the indirect dimensions are incremented together, rather than independently. Spectral analysis of such data is carried out using methods such as filtered back-projection, GFT, or parametric signal modeling. By using Maximum Entropy reconstruction of reduced-dimensionality data, we show that the artifacts that arise in reduced dimensionality experiments are intrinsic to the data sampling, and are not, in general, the result of the methods used to compute spectra. Our results illustrate that reduced dimensionality is a special case of non-uniform sampling in the time domain. We show that MaxEnt reconstruction yields more accurate spectra for reduced dimensionality data than back-projection reconstruction and that randomly choosing time increments based on an exponentially weighted distribution is more efficient, with fewer artifacts, than the systematic coupling of time increments used in most reduced dimensionality approaches. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Numerical counterparts of analog de- vices that perform these operations, such as RC filters, are often considered. However, the method of least squares may be used without additional com- putational complexity and with con- siderable improvement in the informo- tion obtained. The least squares cal- culations may be carried out in the computer by convolution of the data points with properly chosen sets of integers. These sets of integers and their normalizing factors are described and their use is illustrated in spectro- scopic applications. The computer programs required are relatively sim- ple.

The method was demonstrated using a set of 19 proteins with a range of functions. A statistically significant similarity in ligand binding profiles was only observed between the two functionally identical albumins and between the five functionally similar amylases. This new approach is independent of sequence, structure, or evolutionary information and, therefore, extends our ability to analyze and functionally annotate novel genes.},

abstract = {Multivariate analysis on spectroscopic 1H NMR data is well established in metabolomics and other fields where the composition of complex samples is studied. However, biomarker identification can be hampered by overlapping resonances. 2D NMR data provides a more detailed "fingerprint" of the chemical structure and composition of the sample with greatly improved spectral resolution compared to 1H NMR data. In this report, we demonstrate a procedure for the construction of multivariate models based on frequency domain 2D NMR data where the loadings can be visualized as highly informative 2D loading spectra. This method is based on the analysis of raw spectral data without any need for peak picking or integration prior to analysis. Spectral features such as line widths and peak positions are thus retained. Hence, the loadings can be visualized and interpreted on a molecular level as pseudo 2D spectra in order to identify potential biomarkers. To demonstrate this strategy we have analyzed HSQC spectra acquired from populus phloem plant extracts originating from a set of designed experiments with OPLS regression. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

We report here a two-dimensional (2D) (1)H-(13)C NMR strategy (fast metabolite quantification, FMQ, by NMR) for identifying and quantifying the approximately 40 most abundant metabolites in biological samples. To validate this technique, we prepared mixtures of synthetic compounds and extracts from Arabidopsis thaliana, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Medicago sativa. We show that accurate (technical error 2.7\%) molar concentrations can be determined in 12 min using our quantitative 2D (1)H-(13)C NMR strategy. In contrast, traditional 1D (1)H NMR analysis resulted in 16.2\% technical error under nearly ideal conditions. We propose FMQ by NMR as a practical alternative to 1D (1)H NMR for metabolomics studies in which 50-mg (extract dry weight) samples can be obtained.},

In multidimensional NMR, the signal-to-noise advantage might not occur but there are still sound reasons for doing quadrature detection in the indirectly detected domains. Again, there are two common implementations, often called States-Haberkorn and TPPI (time proportional phase increment). The differences between them are explained in some detail.

The golden age of ribosome structure determination is thus drawing to a close, and as it does the focus in the field will shift from structure determination to understanding why the ribosome's structure changes the way it does as it performs its function. Thus in the future, kinetic and thermodynamic experiments will become increasingly important, and as they do, the field will have to start thinking about the dynamics of the ribosome far more carefully than it has in the past. The reasoning that underlies these assertions will be explained, and a more general issue explored, namely what can be said today about the modus operandi of the ribosome. What kind of a device is it?},

abstract = {Fingerprinting together with statistical analysis is often employed to compare samples in metabonomic studies of a disease. Correlation algorithms can aid by extracting information based on the variation patterns of key metabolites. This information can be linked to metabolite identification or to specific up/down-regulated biochemical pathways. Matlab-based software employing the Pearson's correlation algorithm was applied to urine electropherograms from 20 mice infected with the schistosoma parasite. The fingerprints were the sum of electropherograms analysed with normal and reverse polarity, in two different modes MEKC and CZE and with two different capillaries (uncoated and polyacrylamide coated) to provide a broad picture of the samples. Hippurate, a metabolite that was depleted in the infected group and is present in both polarities, was chosen as a test variable; it correlated with itself to a p value of <0.000. Phenylacetylglycine, a metabolite shown as over expressed in the disease, was positively correlated to three metabolites in its same pathway with a correlation coefficient of 0.7 and p<0.000 to phenylalanine, 0.7 and p<0.000 to 2-hydroxyphenylacetic and 0.55 and p<0.003 to phenylacetate. The study shows that the autocorrelation matrix is able to provide extra information from data files acquired by CE analyses. It underlined an up-regulated metabolic path by association in the schistosoma infection model.},

Unfortunately, when measuring serum and plasma, the high protein concentration can obscure the signals originating from low molecular weight metabolites. We evaluated the use of different parameters within the Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) pulse train of fast spin-echoes to remove the macromolecular signal contribution in one-dimensional proton (1H) NMR spectra. Experimental parameters such as the refocusing delay in the CPMG pulse train, pulse miscalibration, and recycle time were examined to assess the ability to remove the protein signals from the spectrum without causing a deleterious effect on the signals originating from free, low molecular weight metabolites. The 1H-NMR spectra of a variety of serum samples spiked with 2???-deoxyadenosine were acquired using various acquisition parameters. Our results show that the delay used in the CPMG spin-echo and the combination of the acquisition pulse flip angle and recycle time are the two major factors affecting the observed metabolite signal amplitudes in the resulting 1H-NMR spectrum.},

The background should be suppressed in order to perform further qualitative or quantitative analysis of the spectra. For this purpose, an intelligent background-correction algorithm is developed, which simulates manual background-correction procedure intelligently. It basically consists of three aspects: (1) accurate peak position detection in the Raman spectrum by continuous wavelet transform (CWT) with the Mexican Hat wavelet as the mother wavelet; (2) peak-width estimation by signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) enhancing derivative calculation based on CWT but with the Haar wavelet as the mother wavelet; and (3) background fitting using penalized least squares with binary masks. This algorithm does not require any preprocessing step for transforming the spectrum into the wavelet space and can suppress the fluorescent background of Raman spectra intelligently and validly. The algorithm is implemented in R language and available as open source software (http://code.google.com/p/baselinewavelet).},

Current methods for template searching constrain template syntax and semantics by their design. Hence there is a need for a more flexible core algorithm upon which to build more sophisticated tools. Statistical analysis of structural similarity is still in its infancy when compared with its analogue in sequence alignment. In the context of template matching, there is an urgent need for normalization of scores so that results from templates with differing sensitivity may be compared directly. RESULTS: We introduce Jess, a fast and flexible algorithm for searching protein structures for small groups of atoms under arbitrary constraints on geometry and chemistry. We apply the algorithm to a set of manually derived enzyme active site templates, and derive an empirical measure for estimating the relative significance of hits encountered using differing templates.},

abstract = {We address the problem of reconstructing a multiband signal from its sub-Nyquist pointwise samples, when the band locations are unknown. Our approach assumes an existing multi-coset sampling. To date, recovery methods for this sampling strategy ensure perfect reconstruction either when the band locations are known, or under strict restrictions on the possible spectral supports. In this paper, only the number of bands and their widths are assumed without any other limitations on the support. We describe how to choose the parameters of the multi-coset sampling so that a unique multiband signal matches the given samples. To recover the signal, the continuous reconstruction is replaced by a single finite-dimensional problem without the need for discretization. The resulting problem is studied within the framework of compressed sensing, and thus can be solved efficiently using known tractable algorithms from this emerging area. We also develop a theoretical lower bound on the average sampling rate required for blind signal reconstruction, which is twice the minimal rate of known-spectrum recovery. Our method ensures perfect reconstruction for a wide class of signals sampled at the minimal rate, and provides a first systematic study of compressed sensing in a truly analog setting. Numerical experiments are presented demonstrating blind sampling and reconstruction with minimal sampling rate.},

The effects of the toxin on rat liver biochemistry were directly observed and characterized by depleted levels of liver glycogen, choline, taurine, trimethylamine N-oxide, and glucose and by elevated levels of lipids and alanine. The highly unsaturated ??-3-type fatty acid was observed for the first time in hydrazine-treated rat liver. The contributions of the metabolites to the separation of control from dosed liver tissues varied depending on the type of spectral editing method used.

abstract = {Many metabolomics, and other high-content or high-throughput, experiments are set up such that the primary aim is the discovery of biomarker metabolites that can discriminate, with a certain level of certainty, between nominally matched ‘case’ and ‘control’ samples. However, it is unfortunately very easy to find markers that are apparently persuasive but that are in fact entirely spurious, and there are well-known examples in the proteomics literature. The main types of danger are not entirely independent of each other, but include bias, inadequate sample size (especially relative to the number of metabolite variables and to the required statistical power to prove that a biomarker is discriminant), excessive false discovery rate due to multiple hypothesis testing, inappropriate choice of particular numerical methods, and overfitting (generally caused by the failure to perform adequate validation and cross-validation). Many studies fail to take these into account, and thereby fail to discover anything of true significance (despite their claims). We summarise these problems, and provide pointers to a substantial existing literature that should assist in the improved design and evaluation of metabolomics experiments, thereby allowing robust scientific conclusions to be drawn from the available data. We provide a list of some of the simpler checks that might improve one’s confidence that a candidate biomarker is not simply a statistical artefact, and suggest a series of preferred tests and visualisation tools that can assist readers and authors in assessing papers. These tools can be applied to individual metabolites by using multiple univariate tests performed in parallel across all metabolite peaks. They may also be applied to the validation of multivariate models. We stress in particular that classical p-values such as  p \&lt; 0.05 , that are often used in biomedicine, are far too optimistic when multiple tests are done simultaneously (as in metabolomics). Ultimately it is desirable that all data and metadata are available electronically, as this allows the entire community to assess conclusions drawn from them. These analyses apply to all high-dimensional ‘omics’ datasets.},

abstract = {Non-uniform sampling (NUS) in NMR spectroscopy is a recognized and powerful tool to minimize acquisition time. Recent advances in reconstruction methodologies are paving the way for the use of NUS in quantitative applications, where accurate measurement of peak intensities is crucial. The presence or absence of NUS artifacts in reconstructed spectra ultimately determines the success of NUS in quantitative NMR. The quality of reconstructed spectra from NUS acquired data is dependent upon the quality of the sampling scheme. Here we demonstrate that the best performing sampling schemes make up a very small percentage of the total randomly generated schemes. A scoring method is found to accurately predict the quantitative similarity between reconstructed NUS spectra and those of fully sampled spectra. We present an easy-to-use protocol to batch generate and rank optimal Poisson-gap NUS schedules for use with 2D NMR with minimized noise and accurate signal reproduction, without the need for the creation of synthetic spectra. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {A new method, MUNIN (Multi-dimensional NMR spectra interpretation), is introduced for the automated interpretation of three-dimensional NMR spectra. It is based on a mathematical concept referred to as three-way decomposition. An NMR spectrum is decomposed into a sum of components, with each component corresponding to one or a group of peaks. Each component is defined as the direct product of three one-dimensional shapes. A consequence is reduction in dimensionality of the spectral data used in further analysis. The decomposition may be applied to frequency-domain or time-domain data, or to a mixture of these. Features of MUNIN include good resolution in crowded regions and the absence of assumptions about line shapes. Uniform sampling of time-domain data, a prerequisite for discrete Fourier transform, is not required. This opens an avenue for the processing of NMR data that do not follow oscillating behaviour, e.g. from relaxation measurements. The application of MUNIN is illustrated for a 1H-15N-NOESY-HSQC, where each component is defined as the set of all NOE peaks formed by a given amide group. As a result, the extraction of structural information simply consists of one-dimensional peak picking of the shape along the NOE-axis obtained for each amide group.},

Pair correlation functions indicate enhanced concentration of urea near the peptide. Stronger hydrogen bonding of urea-peptide compared to water-peptide is observed with preference for helical conformation. The potential of mean force, computed using umbrella sampling, shows only small differences between urea and water solvation that are difficult to quantify. The changes in solvent structure around the peptide are explained by favorable electrostatic interactions (hydrogen bonds) of urea with the peptide backbone. There is no evidence for significant changes in hydrophobic interactions in the two conformations of the peptide in urea solution. Our simulations suggest that urea denatures proteins by preferentially forming hydrogen bonds to the peptide backbone, reducing the barrier for exposing protein residues to the solvent, and reaching the unfolded state.},

This highly conserved protein is found in GC rich Gram-positive bacteria (e.g., the pathogenic Mycobacterium tuberculosis). The unphosphorylated form of OdhI inhibits the OdhA protein, a key enzyme of the TCA cycle, whereas the phosphorylated form is inactive. OdhI is predicted to be mainly a single FHA domain, a module that mediates protein-protein interaction through binding of phosphothreonine peptides, with a disordered N-terminal extension substrate of the serine/threonine protein kinases. In this study, we solved the solution structure of the unphosphorylated and phosphorylated isoforms of the protein. We observed a major conformational change between the two forms characterized by the binding of the phosphorylated N-terminal part of the protein to its own FHA domain, consequently inhibiting it. This structural observation corresponds to a new autoinhibition mechanism described for a FHA domain protein. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In structural studies of large proteins by NMR, global fold determination plays an increasingly important role in providing a first look at a target's topology and reducing assignment ambiguity in NOESY spectra of fully protonated samples. In this work, we demonstrate the use of ultrasparse sampling, a new data processing algorithm, and a 4-D time-shared NOESY experiment (1) to collect all NOEs in (2)H/(13)C/(15)N-labeled protein samples with selectively protonated amide and ILV methyl groups at high resolution in only four days, and (2) to calculate global folds from this data using fully automated resonance assignment. The new algorithm, SCRUB, incorporates the CLEAN method for iterative artifact removal but applies an additional level of iteration, permitting real signals to be distinguished from noise and allowing nearly all artifacts generated by real signals to be eliminated. In simulations with 1.2\% of the data required by Nyquist sampling, SCRUB achieves a dynamic range over 10000:1 (250× better artifact suppression than CLEAN) and completely quantitative reproduction of signal intensities, volumes, and line shapes. Applied to 4-D time-shared NOESY data, SCRUB processing dramatically reduces aliasing noise from strong diagonal signals, enabling the identification of weak NOE crosspeaks with intensities 100× less than those of diagonal signals. Nearly all of the expected peaks for interproton distances under 5 \AA were observed. The practical benefit of this method is demonstrated with structure calculations for 23 kDa and 29 kDa test proteins using the automated assignment protocol of CYANA, in which unassigned 4-D time-shared NOESY peak lists produce accurate and well-converged global fold ensembles, whereas 3-D peak lists either fail to converge or produce significantly less accurate folds. The approach presented here succeeds with an order of magnitude less sampling than required by alternative methods for processing sparse 4-D data.},

Following the least-squares fit, univariate statistics were used to identify metabolites associated with group differences. This method was evaluated through applications on simulated datasets and a murine diabetes dataset. Furthermore, we examined the differential ability of various weighting metrics to correctly identify discriminative markers. Our findings suggest that the weighted least-squares approach is effective for identifying biochemical discriminators of varying physiological states. Additionally, the superiority of specific weighting metrics is demonstrated in particular datasets. An additional strength of this methodology is the ability for individual investigators to couple this analysis with laboratory specific preprocessing techniques. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Xplor-NIH [1] is a generalized package for biomolecular structure determination from experimental NMR data combined with known geometric data. This is achieved by seeking the minimum of a target function comprising terms for the experimental NMR restraints, covalent geometry and non-bonded contacts using a variety of optimization procedures including molecular dynamics in Cartesian and torsion angle space, Monte Carlo methods and conventional gradient-based minimization. Xplor-NIH was originally derived from XPLOR [2] version 3.851 and contains all of the functionality therein. However, Xplor-NIH incorporates numerous completely new features designed to render its overall architecture highly flexible and to foster the rapid and easy development of new and improved functionality. This architecture is comprised of a framework written in C++ with user interfaces to the Python and Tclscripting languages. Features introduced since XPLOR 3.851 include:???A number of additional NMR-specific features related to refinement against NMR observables [3-7] not included in XPLOR 3.851, as well as a variety of knowledge-based database potentials of mean force [8-10].???A reduced variable dynamics module which permits completely generalized minimization and molecular dynamics in torsion angle and Cartesian coordinate space, as well as the effective treatment of rigid bodies [11].???The PASD [12] facility for automatic NOE assignment and structure determination directly from automatically peak-picked multidimensional spectra.???Facilities for refinement against an ensemble of structures, for use, for example, in studies of dynamics [13,14].???A direct interface to the VMD-XPLOR visualization package [15]. We note that despite the numerous additions and modifications present in Xplor-NIH, great care has been taken to ensure that old XPLOR scripts still run as expected. CNS [16] scripts can also be run with very minor modifications. Xplor-NIH is written in a combination of languages. The older code of the XPLOR interface is written in Fortran 77, and it is still possible to compile just this code subset, corresponding closely to XPLOR 3.851. One major change to the Fortran code was the removal of all structure-based limits, so that the maximum number of atom, bonds, etc. is now determined by the amount of the computer's RAM, and not by pre-compiled constants. Most recent computationally intensive code has been developed in the C++ language, with interfaces to the Python and Tcl scripting languages generated automatically with the SWIG package [17]. Much of the non-computationally intensive code is now being developed directly in the Python and Tcl languages, and thus is directly accessible for modification by the end-user without recompilation. The Python interface to Xplor-NIH in particular provides an extensible toolbox for developing further functionality. The full source code package is available by sending email to requests@nmr.cit.nih.gov. Binary packages for most popular Unix and Unix-like operating systems (such as Linux and Mac OS X), as well as documentation and support are available directly from http://nmr.cit.nih.gov/Xplor-NIH/. An agreement with the Accelrys corporation allows us to distribute Xplor-NIH in its entirety (in both source and executable formats) freely to academic users, as well as to distribute freely to industrial users those portions of Xplor-NIH not based on the legacy XPLOR Fortran framework. Commercial use of Xplor-NIH should be arranged with the Accelrys Corporation, but code developed outside the old XPLOR framework (the C++ interface including the IVM, etc.) is available to commercial and noncommercial entities. Xplor-NIH is a collaborative effort, with groups worldwide contributing advice and computer code. Additional contributions are encouraged, and are advantageous to the contributors as well as to end-users. New contributions should adhere to Xplor-NIH coding conventions, and be accompanied by appropriate testing scripts to assure reproducible future operation. This review provides an overview of recent Xplor-NIH development, and an introduction complete with example code, via the Python interface. This review is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a brief introduction to the Python interface. Section 3 introduces some of the most often used potential terms for NMR structure determination, along with Python example code. Section 4 discusses the internal variable module used to manipulate atomic coordinates. Section 5 introduces the parallel structure calculation facilities, while Section 6 discusses facilities for simultaneous refinement of ensembles of structures. Finally, Section 7 presents brief overviews of other Xplor-NIH facilities.},

abstract = {Determination of the 3D structures of multidomain proteins by solution NMR methods presents a number of unique challenges related to their larger molecular size and the usual scarcity of constraints at the interdomain interface, often resulting in a decrease in structural accuracy. In this respect, experimental information from small-angle scattering of X-ray radiation in solution (SAXS) presents a suitable complement to the NMR data, as it provides an independent constraint on the overall molecular shape. A computational procedure is described that allows incorporation of such SAXS data into the mainstream high-resolution macromolecular structure refinement. The method is illustrated for a two-domain 177-amino-acid protein, gammaS crystallin, using an experimental SAXS data set fitted at resolutions from approximately 200 A to approximately 30 A. Inclusion of these data during structure refinement decreases the backbone coordinate root-mean-square difference between the derived model and the high-resolution crystal structure of a 54\% homologous gammaB crystallin from 1.96 +/- 0.07 A to 1.31 +/- 0.04 A. Combining SAXS data with NMR restraints can be accomplished at a moderate computational expense and is expected to become useful for multidomain proteins, multimeric assemblies, and tight macromolecular complexes.},

Comparisons are made with the individual gauge for localized orbitals (IGLO) method of Schindler and Kutzelnigg, and with the localized orbital/local origin (LORG) method of Hansen and Bouman. The GIAO method appears to converge faster than the localized techniques; i.e., it provides the same accuracy with a smaller basis, particularly for the individual tensor components.

We present a simple derivation, based on quaternions, for the optimal solid body transformation (rotation-translation) that minimizes the RMSD between two sets of vectors. We prove that the quaternion method is equivalent to the well-known formula due to Kabsch. We analyze the various cases that may arise, and give a complete enumeration of the special cases in terms of the arrangement of the eigenvalues of a traceless, 4 x 4 symmetric matrix. A key result here is an expression for the gradient of the RMSD as a function of model parameters. This can be useful, for example, in finding the minimum energy path of a reaction using the elastic band methods or in optimizing model parameters to best fit a target structure.},

abstract = {A computer program (SHIFTX) is described which rapidly and accurately calculates the diamagnetic 1H, 13C and 15N chemical shifts of both backbone and sidechain atoms in proteins. The program uses a hybrid predictive approach that employs pre-calculated, empirically derived chemical shift hypersurfaces in combination with classical or semi-classical equations (for ring current, electric field, hydrogen bond and solvent effects) to calculate 1H, 13C and 15N chemical shifts from atomic coordinates. The chemical shift hypersurfaces capture dihedral angle, sidechain orientation, secondary structure and nearest neighbor effects that cannot easily be translated to analytical formulae or predicted via classical means. The chemical shift hypersurfaces were generated using a database of IUPAC-referenced protein chemical shifts--RefDB (Zhang et al., 2003), and a corresponding set of high resolution (\&lt;2.1 A) X-ray structures. Data mining techniques were used to extract the largest pairwise contributors (from a list of approximately 20 derived geometric, sequential and structural parameters) to generate the necessary hypersurfaces. SHIFTX is rapid (\&lt;1 CPU second for a complete shift calculation of 100 residues) and accurate. Overall, the program was able to attain a correlation coefficient (r) between observed and calculated shifts of 0.911 (1Halpha), 0.980 (13Calpha), 0.996 (13Cbeta), 0.863 (13CO), 0.909 (15N), 0.741 (1HN), and 0.907 (sidechain 1H) with RMS errors of 0.23, 0.98, 1.10, 1.16, 2.43, 0.49, and 0.30 ppm, respectively on test data sets. We further show that the agreement between observed and SHIFTX calculated chemical shifts can be an extremely sensitive measure of the quality of protein structures. Our results suggest that if NMR-derived structures could be refined using heteronuclear chemical shifts calculated by SHIFTX, their precision could approach that of the highest resolution X-ray structures.

These include the early intervention of therapeutic strategies leading to a reduction in morbidity and mortality, and the releasing of economic resources within overburdened health care systems. Some of the routine clinical tests currently in use are known to be unsuitable or unreliable. In addition, these often rely on single disease markers which are inappropriate when multiple factors are involved. Many diseases are a result of metabolic disorders, therefore it is logical to measure metabolism directly. One of the strategies employed by the emergent science of metabolomics is metabolic fingerprinting; which involves rapid, high-throughput global analysis to discriminate between samples of different biological status or origin. This review focuses on a selective number of recent studies where metabolic fingerprinting has been forwarded as a potential tool for disease diagnosis using infrared and Raman spectroscopies.},

A number of studies have presented various data manipulation approaches, some suggesting an optimum method. In metabonomics, data are usually presented as a table where each row relates to a given sample or analytical experiment and each column corresponds to a single measurement in that experiment, typically individual spectral peak intensities or metabolite concentrations. Here we suggest definitions for and discuss the operations usually termed normalization (a table row operation) and scaling (a table column operation) and demonstrate their need in 1H NMR spectroscopic data sets derived from urine. The problems associated with "binned" data (i.e., values integrated over discrete spectral regions) are also discussed, and the particular biological context problems of analytical data on urine are highlighted. It is shown that care must be exercised in calculation of correlation coefficients for data sets where normalization to a constant sum is used. Analogous considerations will be needed for other biofluids, other analytical approaches (e.g., HPLC-MS), and indeed for other "omics" techniques (i.e., transcriptomics or proteomics) and for integrated studies with "fused" data sets. It is concluded that data preprocessing is context dependent and there can be no single method for general use.},

In occipital lobe, all relaxation time constants were found to be higher in white matter than in gray matter, demonstrating contrast denoted as an "inverse transverse relaxation contrast." This contrast persisted despite changing the delay between refocusing pulses or changing the magnitude of the spin-lock field strength, which suggests that it does not originate from DA, as might be induced by the presence of Fe, but rather is related to dipolar interactions in the brain tissue.},

We summarize the main NMR spectroscopic applications in modern metabolic research, and provide detailed protocols for biofluid (urine, serum/plasma) and tissue sample collection and preparation, including the extraction of polar and lipophilic metabolites from tissues. 1H NMR spectroscopic techniques such as standard 1D spectroscopy, relaxation-edited, diffusion-edited and 2D J-resolved pulse sequences are widely used at the analysis stage to monitor different groups of metabolites and are described here. They are often followed by more detailed statistical analysis or additional 2D NMR analysis for biomarker discovery. The standard acquisition time per sample is 4-5 min for a simple 1D spectrum, and both preparation and analysis can be automated to allow application to high-throughput screening for clinical diagnostic and toxicological studies, as well as molecular phenotyping and functional genomics.},

@article{Chylla1998,
abstract = {A maximum likelihood (ML)-based approach has been established for the direct extraction of NMR parameters (e.g., frequency, amplitude, phase, and decay rate) simultaneously from all dimensions of a D-dimensional NMR spectrum. The approach, referred to here as HTFD-ML (hybrid time frequency domain maximum likelihood), constructs a time-domain model composed of a sum of exponentially-decaying sinusoidal signals. The apodized Fourier transform of this time-domain signal is a model spectrum that represents the 'best-fit' to the equivalent frequency-domain data spectrum. The desired amplitude and frequency parameters can be extracted directly from the signal model constructed by the HTFD-ML algorithm. The HTFD-ML approach presented here, as embodied in the software package CHIFIT, is designed to meet the challenges posed by model fitting of D-dimensional NMR data sets, where each consists of many data points (10(8) is not uncommon) encoding information about numerous signals (up to 10(5) for a protein of moderate size) that exhibit spectral overlap. The suitability of the approach is demonstrated by its application to the concerted analysis of a series of ten 2D 1H-15N HSQC experiments measuring 15N T1 relaxation. In addition to demonstrating the practicality of performing maximum likelihood analysis on large, multidimensional NMR spectra, the results demonstrate that this parametric model-fitting approach provides more accurate amplitude and frequency estimates than those obtained from conventional peak-based analysis of the FT spectrum. The improved performance of the model fitting approach derives from its ability to take into account the simultaneous contributions of all signals in a crowded spectral region (deconvolution) as well as to incorporate prior knowledge in constructing models to fit the data.},

abstract = {The exchange of energy between a system of nuclear spins immersed in a strong magnetic 6eld, and the heat reservoir consisting of the other degrees of freedom \{the "lattice" ) of the substance containing the magnetic nuclei, serves to bring the spin system into equibbrium at a 6nite tempera- ture. In this condition the system can absorb energy from an applied radiofrequency 6eld. With the absorption of energy, however, the spin temperature tends to rise and the rate of absorption to decrease. Through this "satura- tion" effect, and in some cases by a more direct method, the spin-lettre relaxation time Ti can be measured. The interaction among the magnetic nuclei, with which a characteristic time Tg' is associated, contributes to the width of the absorption line. Both interactions have been studied in a variety of substances, but with the emphasis on liquids containing hydrogen. Magnetic resonance absorption is observed by means of a radiofrequenqy bridge; the magnetic field at the sample is modulated at a low frequency. A detailed analysis of the method by which T\~{} is derived from saturation experiments is given. Relaxation times observed range from 10 4 to 10' seconds. In liquids T\& ordinarily decreases with increasing viscosity, in some cases reaching a mini- mum value after which it increases with further increase in viscosity. The line width meanwhile increases mono- tonically from an extremely small value toward a value determined by the spin-spin interaction in the rigid lattice.}},

abstract = {The bootstrap computer-intensive statistical technique is frequently applied to statistical analyses of phylogenetic trees. The widely used rule that a group is supported significantly if it appears in at least 95\% of bootstrap trees is conservative in most situations. This paper describes three ways of using the bootstrap to carry out statistical inference on phylogenies. The first method tests whether there is nonrandom support for a single group or tree. The second method compares the support for two groups or trees. The third method tests whether a single group or tree has better support than the set of all possible alternatives; this may be a replacement for the "95\% rule." These tests generally require fewer bootstrap trees to be estimated than do other methods of bootstrapping phylogenies. A simple, sequential statistical method can be used to increase the efficiency further. These methods can be applied to tests of multiple hypotheses about a single phylogeny. Parsimony analyses of 5S rRNA sequences of plants and cluster analyses of randomly amplified polymorphic DNA bands in three pathotypes of the cereal eyespot fungus are used as illustrative examples. The tests can be used to analyze dendrograms in subjects other than taxonomy.},

The two CV-ANOVA diagnostics are shown to work well in those cases where PLS and OPLS work well, that is, for data with many and correlated variables, missing data, etc. The utility of the CV-ANOVA diagnostic is demonstrated using three datasets related to (i) the monitoring of an industrial de-inking process; (ii) a pharmaceutical QSAR problem and (iii) a multivariate calibration application from a sugar refinery.

abstract = {A more robust way to obtain a high-resolution multidimensional NMR spectrum from limited data sets is described. The Filter Diagonalization Method (FDM) is used to analyze phase-modulated data and cast the spectrum in terms of phase-sensitive Lorentzian "phase-twist" peaks. These spectra are then used to obtain absorption-mode phase-sensitive spectra. In contrast to earlier implementations of multidimensional FDM, the absolute phase of the data need not be known beforehand, and linear phase corrections in each frequency dimension are possible, if they are required. Regularization is employed to improve the conditioning of the linear algebra problems that must be solved to obtain the spectral estimate. While regularization smoothes away noise and small peaks, a hybrid method allows the true noise floor to be correctly represented in the final result. Line shape transformation to a Gaussian-like shape improves the clarity of the spectra, and is achieved by a conventional Lorentzian-to-Gaussian transformation in the time-domain, after inverse Fourier transformation of the FDM spectra. The results obtained highlight the danger of not using proper phase-sensitive line shapes in the spectral estimate. The advantages of the new method for the spectral estimate are the following: (i) the spectrum can be phased by conventional means after it is obtained; (ii) there is a true and accurate noise floor; and (iii) there is some indication of the quality of fit in each local region of the spectrum. The method is illustrated with 2D NMR data for the first time, but is applicable to n-dimensional data without any restriction on the number of time/frequency dimensions. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {In TROSY experiments, relaxation interference effects are exploited to produce spectra with improved resolution and signal-to-noise. Such experiments cannot be explained using the standard product operator formalism, but must instead be analyzed at the level of individual density matrix elements. Herein we illustrate this point using an example from our recent work on a TROSY 1H–13C correlation experiment for methyl groups in large proteins. Methyl groups are useful spectroscopic probes of protein structure and dynamics because they are found throughout the critical core region of a folded protein and their resonances are intense and well dispersed. Additionally, it is relatively easy to produce highly deuterated protein samples that are 1H,13C labeled at selected methyl positions, facilitating studies of high molecular weight systems. Methyl groups are relaxed by a network of 1H–1H and 1H–13C dipolar interactions, and in the macromolecular limit the destructive interference of these interactions leads to unusually slow relaxation for certain density matrix elements. It is this slow relaxation that forms the basis for TROSY experiments. We present a detailed analysis of evolution and relaxation during HSQC and HMQC pulse schemes for the case of a 13C1H3 spin system attached to a macromolecule. We show that the HMQC sequence is already optimal with respect to the TROSY effect, offering a significant sensitivity enhancement over HSQC at any spectrometer field strength. The gain in sensitivity is established experimentally using samples of two large proteins, malate synthase G (81.4 kDa) and ClpP protease (305 kDa), both highly deuterated and selectively 1H,13C-labeled at isoleucine $\delta$ methyl positions.

abstract = {Quantitative 1H NMR (qHNMR) provides a value-added dimension to the standard spectroscopic data set involved in structure analysis, especially when analyzing bioactive molecules and elucidating new natural products. The qHNMR method can be integrated into any routine qualitative workflow without much additional effort by simply establishing quantitative conditions for the standard solution 1H NMR experiments. Moreover, examination of different chemical lots of taxol (paclitaxel) and a Taxus brevifolia extract as working examples led to a blueprint for a generic approach to performing a routinely practiced 13C-decoupled qHNMR experiment and for recognizing its potential and main limitations. The proposed protocol is based on a newly assembled 13C GARP broadband decoupled proton acquisition sequence that reduces spectroscopic complexity by removal of carbon satellites. The method is capable of providing qualitative and quantitative NMR data simultaneously and covers various analytes from pure compounds to complex mixtures such as metabolomes. Due to a routinely achievable dynamic range of 300:1 (0.3\%) or better, qHNMR qualifies for applications ranging from reference standards to biologically active compounds to metabolome analysis. Providing a "cookbook" approach to qHNMR, acquisition conditions are described that can be adapted for contemporary NMR spectrometers of all major manufacturers.},

The present method was specific for the analysis of these analytes and demonstrated acceptable values for linearity (r 2>0.999 in the range of 0.2-10,000ngmL -1 for all the analytes), recovery (>96\%), precision (\%RSD≤2.0), and sensitivity (on column limit of detection: 250-400fg and limit of quantification: 0.8-1.25pg), indicating that the proposed method could be efficiently used for determination of these analytes in the context of clinical research. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Proline utilization A (PutA) is a membrane-associated multifunctional enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of proline to glutamate in a two-step process. In certain, gram-negative bacteria such as Pseudomonas putida, PutA also acts as an auto repressor in the cytoplasm, when an insufficient concentration of proline is available. Here, the N-terminal residues 1-45 of PutA from P. putida (PpPutA45) are shown to be responsible for DNA binding and dimerization. The solution structure of PpPutA45 was determined using NMR methods, where the protein is shown to be a symmetrical homodimer (12 kDa) consisting of two ribbon-helix-helix (RHH) structures. DNA sequence recognition by PpPutA45 was determined using DNA gel mobility shift assays and NMR chemical shift perturbations (CSPs). PpPutA45 was shown to bind a 14 base-pair DNA oligomer (5'-GCGGTTGCACCTTT-3'). A model of the PpPutA45-DNA oligomer complex was generated using Haddock 2.1. The antiparallel beta-sheet that results from PpPutA45 dimerization serves as the DNA recognition binding site by inserting into the DNA major groove. The dimeric core of four alpha-helices provides a structural scaffold for the beta-sheet from which residues Thr5, Gly7, and Lys9 make sequence-specific contacts with the DNA. The structural model implies flexibility of Lys9 which can make hydrogen bond contacts with either guanine or thymine. The high sequence and structure conservation of the PutA RHH domain suggest interdomain interactions play an important role in the evolution of the protein.},

abstract = {It is now well understood that (1) it is possible to reconstruct sparse signals exactly from what appear to be highly incomplete sets of linear measurements and (2) that this can be done by constrained L1 minimization. In this paper, we study a novel method for sparse signal recovery that in many situations outperforms L1 minimization in the sense that substantially fewer measurements are needed for exact recovery. The algorithm consists of solving a sequence of weighted L1-minimization problems where the weights used for the next iteration are computed from the value of the current solution. We present a series of experiments demonstrating the remarkable performance and broad applicability of this algorithm in the areas of sparse signal recovery, statistical estimation, error correction and image processing. Interestingly, superior gains are also achieved when our method is applied to recover signals with assumed near-sparsity in overcomplete representations--not by reweighting the L1 norm of the coefficient sequence as is common, but by reweighting the L1 norm of the transformed object. An immediate consequence is the possibility of highly efficient data acquisition protocols by improving on a technique known as compressed sensing.},

abstract = {The full resolution afforded by high-field magnets is rarely realized in the indirect dimensions of multidimensional NMR experiments because of the time cost of uniformly sampling to long evolution times. Emerging methods utilizing nonuniform sampling (NUS) enable high resolution along indirect dimensions by sampling long evolution times without sampling at every multiple of the Nyquist sampling interval. While the earliest NUS approaches matched the decay of sampling density to the decay of the signal envelope, recent approaches based on coupled evolution times attempt to optimize sampling by choosing projection angles that increase the likelihood of resolving closely-spaced resonances. These approaches employ knowledge about chemical shifts to predict optimal projection angles, whereas prior applications of tailored sampling employed only knowledge of the decay rate. In this work we adapt the matched filter approach as a general strategy for knowledge-based nonuniform sampling that can exploit prior knowledge about chemical shifts and is not restricted to sampling projections. Based on several measures of performance, we find that exponentially weighted random sampling (envelope matched sampling) performs better than shift-based sampling (beat matched sampling). While shift-based sampling can yield small advantages in sensitivity, the gains are generally outweighed by diminished robustness. Our observation that more robust sampling schemes are only slightly less sensitive than schemes highly optimized using prior knowledge about chemical shifts has broad implications for any multidimensional NMR study employing NUS. The results derived from simulated data are demonstrated with a sample application to PfPMT, the phosphoethanolamine methyltransferase of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum.},

In this work, an algorithm is proposed to perform an optimized bucketing that yields better results than the conventional bucketing implemented in some commercial software. The improvement proposed here for optimized bucketing deals with the bucket boundaries, which are defined by local minima from average NMR spectrum over all samples. Applicability of the new algorithm, named OBA (optimized bucketing algorithm), is demonstrated for real data sets in comparison to other alignment approaches and conventional bucketing. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Large amounts of data from high-throughput metabolomic experiments are commonly visualized using a principal component analysis (PCA) two-dimensional scores plot. The question of the similarity or difference between multiple metabolic states then becomes a question of the degree of overlap between their respective data point clusters in principal component (PC) scores space. A qualitative visual inspection of the clustering pattern in PCA scores plots is a common protocol. This article describes the application of tree diagrams and bootstrapping techniques for an improved quantitative analysis of metabolic PCA data clustering. Our PCAtoTree program creates a distance matrix with 100 bootstrap steps that describes the separation of all clusters in a metabolic data set. Using accepted phylogenetic software, the distance matrix resulting from the various metabolic states is organized into a phylogenetic-like tree format, where bootstrap values ≥50 indicate a statistically relevant branch separation. PCAtoTree analysis of two previously published data sets demonstrates the improved resolution of metabolic state differences using tree diagrams. In addition, for metabolomic studies of large numbers of different metabolic states, the tree format provides a better description of similarities and differences between each metabolic state. The approach is also tolerant of sample size variations between different metabolic states. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.},

The molar decadic absorption coefficients of caffeine in water and dichloromethane at these wavelengths are 1115 and 1010 m2 mol-1, respectively. The calculated values for the transitional dipole moment of caffeine in water and in dichloromethane are 10.40 ?? 10-30 and 10.80 ?? 10-30 C m, respectively. After characterizing caffeine in water and dichloromethane, fast and simple methods were developed that enable to quantify the content of caffeine in coffee beans. The methods helped in extracting caffeine from coffee dissolved in water by dichloromethane, and Gaussian fit was applied to eliminate the possible interference with the caffeine spectra. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Resolution depends on the number of points sampled in a FID; in indirectly detected dimensions it is an important determinant of the total experiment time. Based on the high redundancy present in NMR data, we propose the following timesaving scheme for three-dimensional spectra. An extensive grid of discrete t1- and t2-values is used, which increases resolution while preserving the spectral width. Total experiment time is reduced by avoiding the recording of t3-FIDs for selected pairs of t1 and t2; typically the recording is omitted for about 75\% of the (t1,t2) combinations. These data sets are referred to as sparse, and post-experimental processing making optimal use of spectral redundancy provides the missing, non-recorded data. We have previously shown that three-way decomposition (TWD) within the MUNIN approach provides a practical way to process dense NMR data sets. Here, a novel TWD algorithm [Ibraghimov, (2002) Numer. Linear Algebra Appl. 9, 551-565] is used to complement a sparsely recorded time-domain data set by providing the missing FIDs for all (t1,t2) combinations omitted in the experiment. A necessary condition is that for each t1-value at least a few FIDs are recorded, and similar for each t2-value. The method is demonstrated on non-uniformly sampled (15)N-NOESY-HSQC data sets recorded for the 14 kD protein azurin. The spectra obtained by TWD, reconstruction and ordinary transform to frequency-domain are, in spite of the large number of signals and the high dynamic range typical for NOESYs, highly similar to a corresponding reference spectrum, for which all (t1,t2) combinations were recorded.},

It is based on the whitening concept formulated as the 'maximization of the number of white pixels into a bitmap that corresponds to the spectrum'. This process of maximization can be factorized along the individual axes of the spectrum and this property makes the method robust and fast. It employs a statistic measure based on a large number of spectral data points and, for this reason, is very tolerant to low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and local artifacts. The algorithm can efficiently phase either homonuclear or heteronuclear experiments and, unlike other previous methods, it can also process automatically spectra containing positive or negative peaks so that it is not necessary to deal with individual or special cases.},

abstract = {Trains of spin echoes are normally modulated by homonuclear scalar couplings. It has long been known that echo modulations are quenched when the pulse-repetition rates are much larger than the offsets of the coupling partners, because the spin systems behave as if they consisted of magnetically equivalent spins when the offsets are suppressed. This type of quenching of the echo modulations can occur when the radio-frequency (RF) pulses are ideal, that is, when they are perfectly homogeneous, properly calibrated to induce rotations through an angle, pi, and have an RF amplitude, omega(1)=-gammaB(1), that is strong compared to the largest offset, Omega(S)=omega(0S)-omega(RF), with respect to the carrier frequency. Recently, it was discovered that echo modulations can also be quenched when the RF pulses are nonideal, that is, when they are too weak to bring about an ideal rotation of the magnetization of the coupling partners, so that the effective fields associated with the RF pulses are tilted in the rotating frame. This phenomenon typically occurs when the pulse-repetition rates are much slower than the offset of the coupling partner. Under such conditions, it turns out, however, that for certain offsets, when the phase, Phi(S) (which arises from a free precession of the magnetization of the coupling partner, S, in the pulse interval, 2tau, and the pulse length, tau(pi)), approaches a multiple of 2pi, the echo modulations are restored. However, the frequencies of these echo modulations are not simply determined by the homonuclear scalar coupling, J(IS). The Fourier transforms of the echo trains (the so-called "J spectra") reveal surprising multiplet patterns, and the amplitudes of the echo modulations depend on the offsets of the coupling partners. Herein, we present a unified theory, based on an average-Hamiltonian approach, to describe these effects for two-spin systems. Experimental evidence of echo modulations in a system of two spins is presented. Experiments with three and more spins, backed up by extensive numerical simulations, will be presented elsewhere.},

abstract = {Even moderate distortion at the beginning of the NMR signal contributes significantly to the baseline in the reciprocal domain, when the FID-type experiment is considered. If constant phase artifact is also involved, the net problem cannot be resolved accurately, according to its constituents considered in separation. This issue is particularly severe for powder patterns in solids, featuring complex broadband spectra, which substantially mask the baseline behavior. The complete correction procedure should intrinsically deal with both artifacts, due to the mutual dependency. The aim of this work is to indicate the possibility for the exact treatment of baseline and constant phase artifacts together, providing precise measure whether the correction is successful. We have found the analytical, noniterative solution for this coupled problem in the closed form. In this paper, we introduce the correction efficiency concept in order to have the measure for the correction reliability of the resulting spectrum. Relevant efficiency parameter ?? is the subject for quantitative analysis resulting in certain constraints for the measurement. We have determined exemplar trends for this parameter as a function of experimental variables such as signal-to-noise ratio and missing points number. The method is model-free and drawn from the origin of the baseline artifact; therefore has potential to work for a broad range of applications. ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

@article{Du2006,
abstract = {MOTIVATION: A major problem for current peak detection algorithms is that noise in mass spectrometry (MS) spectra gives rise to a high rate of false positives. The false positive rate is especially problematic in detecting peaks with low amplitudes. Usually, various baseline correction algorithms and smoothing methods are applied before attempting peak detection. This approach is very sensitive to the amount of smoothing and aggressiveness of the baseline correction, which contribute to making peak detection results inconsistent between runs, instrumentation and analysis methods. RESULTS: Most peak detection algorithms simply identify peaks based on amplitude, ignoring the additional information present in the shape of the peaks in a spectrum. In our experience, 'true' peaks have characteristic shapes, and providing a shape-matching function that provides a 'goodness of fit' coefficient should provide a more robust peak identification method. Based on these observations, a continuous wavelet transform (CWT)-based peak detection algorithm has been devised that identifies peaks with different scales and amplitudes. By transforming the spectrum into wavelet space, the pattern-matching problem is simplified and in addition provides a powerful technique for identifying and separating the signal from the spike noise and colored noise. This transformation, with the additional information provided by the 2D CWT coefficients can greatly enhance the effective signal-to-noise ratio. Furthermore, with this technique no baseline removal or peak smoothing preprocessing steps are required before peak detection, and this improves the robustness of peak detection under a variety of conditions. The algorithm was evaluated with SELDI-TOF spectra with known polypeptide positions. Comparisons with two other popular algorithms were performed. The results show the CWT-based algorithm can identify both strong and weak peaks while keeping false positive rate low. AVAILABILITY: The algorithm is implemented in R and will be included as an open source module in the Bioconductor project.},

It finds applications in stereophotogrammetry and in robotics. I present here a closed-form solution to the least-squares problem for three or more points. Currently various empirical, graphical, and numerical iterative methods are in use. Derivation of the solution is simplified by use of unit quaternions to represent rotation. I emphasize a symmetry property that a solution to this problem ought to possess. The best translational offset is the difference between the centroid of the coordinates in one system and the rotated and scaled centroid of the coordinates in the other system. The best scale is equal to the ratio of the root-mean-square deviations of the coordinates in the two systems from their respective centroids. These exact results are to be preferred to approximate methods based on measurements of a few selected points. The unit quaternion representing the best rotation is the eigenvector associated with the most positive eigenvalue of a symmetric 4 × 4 matrix. The elements of this matrix are combinations of sums of products of corresponding coordinates of the points.},

@article{Kazimierczuk2012,
abstract = {The resolution of multidimensional NMR spectra can be severely limited when regular sampling based on the Nyquist-Shannon theorem is used. The theorem binds the sampling rate with a bandwidth of a sampled signal and thus implicitly creates a dependence between the line width and the time of experiment, often making the latter one very long. Recently, Cand??s et al. (2006) [25] formulated a non-linear sampling theorem that determines the required number of sampling points to be dependent mostly on the number of peaks in a spectrum and only slightly on the number of spectral points. The result was pivotal for rapid development and broad use of signal processing method called compressed sensing. In our previous work, we have introduced compressed sensing to multidimensional NMR and have shown examples of reconstruction of two-dimensional spectra. In the present paper we discuss in detail the accuracy and robustness of two compressed sensing algorithms: convex (iterative soft thresholding) and non-convex (iteratively re-weighted least squares with local ???0-norm) in application to two- and three-dimensional datasets. We show that the latter method is in many terms more effective, which is in line with recent works on the theory of compressed sensing. We also present the comparison of both approaches with multidimensional decomposition which is one of the established methods for processing of non-linearly sampled data. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.

@article{Moskau2002,
abstract = {Since the introduction of Fourier transform NMR spectroscopy, free induction decay (FID) has been available in a binary format, which is required to apply several mathematical treatments on the raw data. Those mathematical procedures are the application of window functions on the FID, baseline correction of the time domain data, and finally the Fourier transformation. Nevertheless, it took a long time until digital filtering was applied on NMR raw data. Digital filtering can be done as either a postprocessing procedure or on the fly. The on the fly concept is preferable, but it requires specialized and very fast processors. With the common availability of such processors, called digital signal processors (DSP), digital filtering on NMR raw data became a routine method. The application of digital filters allows us to overcome problems such as baseline distortion in the NMR spectrum due to nonperfect phase response of any common analog antialiasing filter, distortion of the signal amplitude due to a nonperfect amplitude response of any common analog antialiasing filter, a limited dynamic range due to aliased noise by nonoversampling techniques, reduced dynamic range due to quantization noise, and folded signals due to folded signals outside of the spectral window. The manner in which digital filters are used in a NMR spectrometer is the same as audio applications; it just requires stronger processors to apply high-performance digital filters on the fly. This article is an introduction to the concept of digital filters. Therefore, the description is strongly simplified and the ideal case is assumed.},

PCA of FTIR data resulted in the separation of beers mainly according to their alcoholic content, providing little information on components other than ethanol contributing to the variability within the samples. PCA of (1)H NMR spectra, performed on the region where major beer components resonate (3.0-6.0 ppm), resulted in the separation of samples into four groups: two groups characterized by the predominance of dextrins, one group of alcohol-free beers characterized by the predominance of maltose, and one group where glucose was found to predominate. By performing PCA on aliphatic and aromatic regions, the contribution of minor components was highlighted. In particular, most ales, lagers, and alcohol-free samples could be distinguished based on their aromatic composition, thus reflecting the high sensitivity of the low-field NMR region toward different types of beer fermentation.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Many hereditary human diseases are polygenic, resulting from sequence alterations in multiple genes. Genomic linkage and association studies are commonly performed for identifying disease-related genes. Such studies often yield lists of up to several hundred candidate genes, which have to be prioritized and validated further. Recent studies discovered that genes involved in phenotypically similar diseases are often functionally related on the molecular level. RESULTS: Here, we introduce MedSim, a novel approach for ranking candidate genes for a particular disease based on functional comparisons involving the Gene Ontology. MedSim uses functional annotations of known disease genes for assessing the similarity of diseases as well as the disease relevance of candidate genes. We benchmarked our approach with genes known to be involved in 99 diseases taken from the OMIM database. Using artificial quantitative trait loci, MedSim achieved excellent performance with an area under the ROC curve of up to 0.90 and a sensitivity of over 70\% at 90\% specificity when classifying gene products according to their disease relatedness. This performance is comparable or even superior to related methods in the field, albeit using less and thus more easily accessible information. AVAILABILITY: MedSim is offered as part of our FunSimMat web service (http://www.funsimmat.de).},

A prototype system has been built using a set of small, off the shelf commercially available permanent magnets. Proton linewidths of 50 ppm FWHM could be achieved at a field strength of 1 T. Calculations show that with custom-sized permanent magnets, linewidths of less than 1 ppm can be achieved over sample volumes of up to 1 mm3, which would in theory enable chemical shift resolved proton spectroscopy on mass-limited samples. But even with the achieved linewidth of 50 ppm, this can be a useful portable sensor for small amounts of liquid samples with restricted molecular mobility, like gels, polymers or high viscosity liquids. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Broadly based on the progressive pairwise heuristic, this algorithm gains accuracy through novel and effective refinement phases. MUSTANG reports the multiple sequence alignment and the corresponding superposition of structures. Alignments generated by MUSTANG are compared with several handcurated alignments in the literature as well as with the benchmark alignments of 1033 alignment families from the HOMSTRAD database. The performance of MUSTANG was compared with DALI at a pairwise level, and with other multiple structural alignment tools such as POSA, CE-MC, MALECON, and MultiProt.

A geometry of 16 magnets provided a good compromise between performance and special requirements for the desired use to store hyperpolarized xenon. The construction of such a magnet required the design of dedicated support frames and procedures to mount them. The field strength and homogeneity in the finished magnet were measured by a Hall probe and agreed well with the simulations.

abstract = {Electric fields affect any process or transition that involves the movement of charge. Stark spectroscopy is a general term describing the study of spectral changes in the presence of electric fields, and it has proven to be a broadly useful approach for characterizing the change in dipole moment and polarizability for electronic and vibrational transitions. This article focuses primarily on the evolution of the approach and interconnected applications in diverse fields from our laboratory and prospects for the future. Our work began with studies of chromophores in photosynthetic reaction centers whose function is light-driven charge separation, so perturbations by an electric field were a natural approach. The same methods have been applied to many other biological and nonbiological chromophores. A common theme has been understanding the mechanism(s) of symmetry breaking in molecules or organized assemblies of high symmetry. Spectral shifts in organized systems due to mutations, conformational changes, and ligand binding can, in some cases, be interpreted as Stark shifts. In this case, Stark spectroscopy in a well-defined electric field provides a calibration of the probe transition's sensitivity to an electric field, and the Stark shifts of suitable probes can be used to measure the magnitude and direction of electric fields in proteins, nucleic acids, and membranes. Electric fields can also perturb the populations or reaction dynamics of processes where charge separation occurs. When detected by spectroscopic methods, we call these nonclassical Stark effects. Nonclassical Stark effects arise in the spectroscopy of intervalence charge transfer transitions and both ground- and excited-state electron transfer reactions. Because the movement of charge is ubiquitous in chemistry, biology, and materials science and because electric fields directly affect the energetics of charge-separated species, many phenomena can be viewed as generalizations of the Stark effect.},

abstract = {The determination of macromolecular structures requires weighting of experimental evidence relative to prior physical information. Although it can critically affect the quality of the calculated structures, experimental data are routinely weighted on an empirical basis. At present, cross-validation is the most rigorous method to determine the best weight. We describe a general method to adaptively weight experimental data in the course of structure calculation. It is further shown that the necessity to define weights for the data can be completely alleviated. We demonstrate the method on a structure calculation from NMR data and find that the resulting structures are optimal in terms of accuracy and structural quality. Our method is devoid of the bias imposed by an empirical choice of the weight and has some advantages over estimating the weight by cross-validation.},

This paper concerns the use of the bootstrap in the tree problem.

abstract = {Spectroscopic profiling of biological samples is an integral part of metabolically driven top-down systems biology and can be used for identifying biomarkers of toxicity and disease. However, optimal biomarker information recovery and resonance assignment still pose significant challenges in NMR-based complex mixture analysis. The reduced signal overlap as achieved when projecting two-dimensional (2D) J-resolved (JRES) NMR spectra can be exploited to mitigate this problem and, here, full-resolution (1)H JRES projections have been evaluated as a tool for metabolic screening and biomarker identification. We show that the recoverable information content in JRES projections is intrinsically different from that in the conventional one-dimensional (1D) and Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) spectra, because of the combined result of reduction of the over-representation of highly split multiplet peaks and relaxation editing. Principal component and correlation analyses of full-resolution JRES spectral data demonstrated that peak alignment is necessary. The application of statistical total correlation spectroscopy (STOCSY) to JRES projections improved the identification of previously overlapped small molecule resonances in JRES (1)H NMR spectra, compared to conventional 1D and CPMG spectra. These approaches are demonstrated using a galactosamine-induced hepatotoxicity study in rats and show that JRES projections have a useful and complementary role to standard one-dimensional experiments in complex mixture analysis for improved biomarker identification.},

This can be exploited in water flip-back versions of NOESY and TOCSY experiments of proteins, but care must be taken to limit the effect of the radiation damping field from the water on the H a protons.

abstract = {A generic preprocessing method for multivariate data, called orthogonal projections to latent structures (O-PLS), is described. O-PLS removes variation from X (descriptor variables) that is not correlated to Y (property variables, e.g. yield, cost or toxicity). In mathematical terms this is equivalent to removing systematic variation in X that is orthogonal to Y. In an earlier paper, Wold et al. (Chemometrics Intell, Lab. Syst. 1998; 44:175-185) described orthogonal signal correction (OSC). In this paper a method with the same objective but with different means is described. The proposed O-PLS method analyzes the variation explained in each PLS component. The non-correlated systematic variation in X is removed, making interpretation of the resulting PLS model easier and with the additional benefit that the non-correlated variation itself can be analyzed further. As an example, near-infrared (NIR) reflectance spectra of wood chips were analyzed. Applying O-PLS resulted in reduced model complexity with preserved prediction ability, effective removal of noncorrelated variation in X and, not least, improved interpretational ability of both correlated and noncorrelated variation in the NIR spectra.

abstract = {Transverse relaxation-optimized spectroscopy (TROSY) yields greatly improved sensitivity for multidimensional NMR experiments with aromatic spin systems in proteins. TROSY makes use of the fact that due to the large anisotropy of the 13C chemical shift tensor, the transverse relaxation of one component of the 13C doublet in aromatic 13C?1H moieties is reduced by interference of dipole?dipole (DD) coupling and chemical shift anisotropy (CSA) relaxation. The full advantage of TROSY for studies of aromatic spin systems is obtained at presently available resonance frequencies from 500 to 800 MHz. Since the 13C chemical shifts are recorded using a constant-time evolution period, the TROSY improvement in signal-to-noise relative to corresponding conventional NMR experiments increases with increasing molecular size and can be further significantly enhanced by combined use of the 1H and 13C steady-state magnetizations.With selective observation of the slowly relaxing component of the 13C doublets in experiments recorded without 1H decoupling during the 13C chemical shift evolution period, a 4?10-fold sensitivity gain for individual aromatic 13C?1H correlation peaks was achieved for the uniformly 13C-labeled 18 kDa protein cyclophilin A. A new 3D ct-TROSY-HCCH-COSY experiment is presented, which correlates the resonances of 13C nuclei with those of covalently bound 13C?1H groups and can be applied for complete identification of aromatic spin systems. In this scheme the chemical shift evolution of neighboring aromatic 13C spins are recorded in two indirectly detected spectral dimensions, so that the additional third dimension is obtained without increase of the number of delays.},

In this context "high fidelity" means that each true NMR transition is represented by a single entry, with no spurious entries and no missed peaks. A high fidelity line list allows the measurement of chemical shifts and coupling constants with good accuracy and precision and is the ultimate in data compression. There are two parts to the problem. The first is to overcome common imperfections: the non-Lorentzian lineshapes that can arise whenever the magnetic field inhomogeneity is less than perfect, and nonzero time delays that cause frequency-dependent phase errors. The second is to fit the spectral features to a model of Lorentzian lines. We use the recently developed filter diagonalization method (FDM) to accomplish the reference deconvolution, the phase correction, and the fitting, and show good progress toward the goal of obtaining a high fidelity line list.},

abstract = {The inclusion of explicit solvent water in molecular dynamics refinement of NMR structures ought to provide the most physically meaningful accounting for the effects of solvent on structure, but is computationally expensive. In order to evaluate the validity of commonly used vacuum refinements and of recently developed continuum solvent model methods, we have used three different methods to refine a set of NMR solution structures of a medium sized protein, Escherichia coli glutaredoxin 2, from starting structures calculated using the program DYANA. The three different refinement protocols used molecular dynamics simulated annealing with the program AMBER in vacuum (VAC), including a generalized Born (GB) solvent model, and a full calculation including explicit solvent water (WAT). The structures obtained using the three methods of refinements were very similar, a reflection of their generally well-determined nature. However, the structures refined with the generalized Born model were more similar to those from explicit water refinement than those refined in vacuum. Significant improvement was seen in the percentage of backbone dihedral angles in the most favored regions of phi, psi space and in hydrogen bond pattern for structures refined with the GB and WAT models, compared with the structures refined in vacuum. The explicit water calculation took an average of 200 h of CPU time per structure on an SGI cluster, compared to 15-90 h for the GB calculation (depending on the parameters used) and 2 h for the vacuum calculation. The generalized Born solvent model proved to be an excellent compromise between the vacuum and explicit water refinements, giving results comparable to those of the explicit water calculation. Some improvement for phi and psi angle distribution and hydrogen bond pattern can also be achieved by energy minimizing the vacuum structures with the GB model, which takes a much shorter time than MD simulations with the GB model.},

abstract = {A method to obtain high reproducibility of 1H NMR chemical shift of peaks of biofluid metabolites, by simple acidification with HCl is evaluated. Biofluid 1H NMR analysis is indeed spoiled by a strong chemical shift dependence of metabolite peaks on parameters such as ionic strength, concentration of some earth alkali cations and, mostly, on pH of samples. The resulting chemical shift variations, as large as 0.1ppm, generate misalignments of homogeneous peaks, artifacts and misinterpretations. Reproducible alignment is essential in 1H NMR based metabonomics, where peak misalignments prevent even very wide bins (i.e., 0.04ppm, as elsewhere proposed) from being used to integrate spectral data for multivariate statistical analysis. Here is demonstrated that routine acidification with HCl to 1.2???pH???2.0 ensures highly reproducible peak alignment of urine 1H NMR spectra. In this respect, simple inspection of citrate peaks in the urine can be used to measure pH, as it will be extensively discussed, in that at such low pH they show no dependency on other urine components as reported at higher pH. Under these conditions, in as many as 493 urine samples, in which concentrations of Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, Na+, Cl-, phosphate, and creatinine and ionic strength measured by means of well standardized conventional procedures, showed very wide ranges, peaks align within a SD always lower than 0.002ppm, thus allowing the use of integration bins at least five times narrower than 0.04ppm. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Living cell metabolism is often monitored by 1D NMR spectroscopy, but the spectral resolution and the short cell lifetime are certainly limiting aspects. 2D spectroscopy does yield higher resolution but is time-consuming since acquisition of the second dimension requires several minutes. However, after only few minutes, oxygen starvation changes cell metabolism, and long acquisition times may yield spectra that do not represent the cell physiological state. Accordingly, metabolic studies of cells require fast NMR data acquisition. Here, we have applied band-selective optimized flip-angle short-transient (SOFAST)-HMQC techniques to (15)N-labeled cells, showing for the first time that it is possible to obtain 2D (1)H-(15)N correlation spectra of small metabolites directly in living cells, in a few seconds and with a high S/N ratio. SOFAST-HMQC spectra of (15)N-labeled Thalassiosira rotula diatoms cells can be acquired in 10-15 s, and, as an application, we have detected a progressive variation of the amino acid content when diatoms are exposed to UV-B radiation, with no need of long analytical procedures to quantify the metabolic changes. We believe that fast acquisition techniques can easily be extended to other cell systems, foreseeing a wide application in the emerging fields of metabolomics and metabonomics, being able to picture the "instantaneous" in-cell metabolism.},

abstract = {There is a general consensus that supports the need for standardized reporting of metadata or information describing large-scale metabolomics and other functional genomics data sets. Reporting of standard metadata provides a biological and empirical context for the data, facilitates experimental replication, and enables the re-interrogation and comparison of data by others. Accordingly, the Metabolomics Standards Initiative is building a general consensus concerning the minimum reporting standards for metabolomics experiments of which the Chemical Analysis Working Group (CAWG) is a member of this community effort. This article proposes the minimum reporting standards related to the chemical analysis aspects of metabolomics experiments including: sample preparation, experimental analysis, quality control, metabolite identification, and data pre-processing. These minimum standards currently focus mostly upon mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy due to the popularity of these techniques in metabolomics. However, additional input concerning other techniques is welcomed and can be provided via the CAWG on-line discussion forum at http://msi-workgroups.sourceforge.net/ or http://Msi-workgroups-feedback@lists.sourceforge.net.

abstract = {A nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiment is described for the direct detection of N-H[...]O=C hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) in 15N and 13C isotope-labeled biomolecules. This quantitative 'long-range' HNCO-COSY (correlation spectroscopy) experiment detects and quantifies electron-mediated scalar couplings across the H-bond (H-bond scalar couplings), which connect the magnetically active (15)N and (13)C nuclei on both sides of the H-bond. Detectable H-bonds comprise the canonical backbone H-bonds in proteins as well as other H-bonds in proteins and nucleic acids with N-H donors and O=C (carbonylic or carboxylic) acceptors. Unlike other NMR observables, which provide only indirect evidence of the presence of H-bonds, the H-bond scalar couplings identify all partners of the H-bond, the donor, the donor proton and the acceptor, in a single experiment. The size of the scalar couplings can be related to H-bond geometries. The time required to detect the N-H[...]O=C H-bonds in small proteins (< or = approximately 10 kDa) is typically on the order of 1 d at millimolar concentrations, whereas H-bond detection for larger proteins (< or = approximately 30 kDa) may be possible within several days depending on concentration, isotope composition, magnetic field strength and molecular weight. The proteins ubiquitin (8.6 kDa), dimeric RANTES (2 x 8.5 kDa) and MAP30 (30 kDa) are used as examples to illustrate this procedure.},

abstract = {Herein we describe the program FAST-Modelfree for the fully automated, high throughput analysis of NMR spin-relaxation data. This program interfaces with the program Modelfree 4.1 and provides an intuitive graphical user interface for configuration as well as complete standalone operation during the model selection and rotational diffusion parameter optimization processes. FAST-Modelfree is also capable of iteratively assigning models to each spin and optimizing the parameters that describe the diffusion tensor. Tests with the protein Ribonuclease A indicate that using this iterative approach even poor initial estimates of the diffusion tensor parameters will converge to the optimal value within a few iterations. In addition to improving the quality of the final fit, this represents a substantial timesaving compared to manual data analysis and minimizes the chance of human error. It is anticipated that this program will be particularly useful for the analysis and comparison of data collected under different conditions such as multiple temperatures and the presence and absence of ligands. Further, this program is intended to establish a more uniform protocol for NMR spin-relaxation data analysis, facilitating the comparison of results both between and within research laboratories. Results obtained with FAST-Modelfree are compared with previous literature results for the proteins Ribonuclease H, E. coli glutaredoxin-1 and the Ca(2+)-binding protein S100B. These proteins represent data sets collected at both single and multiple static magnetic fields and which required analysis with both isotropic and axially symmetric rotational diffusion tensors. In all cases results obtained with FAST-Modelfree compared favorably with the original literature results.},

abstract = {Structure-based drug discovery requires the iterative determination of protein-ligand costructures in order to improve the binding affinity and selectivity of potential drug candidates. In general, X-ray and NMR structure determination methods are time consuming and are typically the limiting factor in the drug discovery process. The application of molecular docking simulations to filter and evaluate drug candidates has become a common method to improve the throughput and efficiency of structure-based drug design. Unfortunately, molecular docking methods suffer from common problems that include ambiguous ligand conformers or failure to predict the correct docked structure. A rapid approach to determine accurate protein-ligand costructures is described based on NMR chemical shift perturbation (CSP) data routinely obtained using 2D 1H-15N HSQC spectra in high-throughput ligand affinity screens. The CSP data is used to both guide and filter AutoDock calculations using our AutoDockFilter program. This method is demonstrated for 19 distinct protein-ligand complexes where the docked conformers exhibited an average rmsd of 1.17 +/- 0.74 A relative to the original X-ray structures for the protein-ligand complexes.},

abstract = {Nuclear resonance techniques involving free precession are examined, and, in particular, a convenient variation of Hahn's spin-echo method is described. This variation employs a combination of pulses of different intensity or duration ("90-degree" and "180-degree" pulses). Measurements of the transverse relaxation time T2 in fluids are often severely compromised by molecular diffusion. Hahn's analysis of the effect of diffusion is reformulated and extended, and a new scheme for measuring T2 is described which, as predicted by the extended theory, largely circumvents the diffusion effect. On the other hand, the free precession technique, applied in a different way, permits a direct measurement of the molecular self-diffusion constant in suitable fluids. A measurement of the self-diffusion constant of water at 25°C is described which yields D=2.5(±0.3)×10-5 cm2/sec, in good agreement with previous determinations. An analysis of the effect of convection on free precession is also given. A null method for measuring the longitudinal relaxation time T1, based on the unequal-pulse technique, is described.},

abstract = {Superpositioning of atoms in an ensemble of biomolecules is a common task in a variety of fields in structural biology. Although several automated tools exist based on previously established methods, manual operations to define the atoms in the ordered regions are usually preferred. The task is difficult and lacks output efficiency for multi-core proteins having complicated folding topology. The new method presented here can systematically and quantitatively achieve the identification of ordered cores even for molecules containing multiple cores linked with flexible loops. In contrast to established methods, this method treats the variance of inter-atomic distances in an ensemble as information content using a non-linear (NL) function, and then subjects it to multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) to embed the row vectors in the inter-atomic distance variance matrix into a lower dimensional matrix. The plots of the identified atom groups in a one or two-dimensional map enables users to visually and intuitively infer well-ordered atoms in an ensemble, as well as to automatically identify them by the standard clustering methods. The performance of the NL-MDS method has been examined for number of structure ensembles studied by nuclear magnetic resonance, demonstrating that the method can be more suitable for structural analysis of multi-core proteins in comparison to previously established methods.},

abstract = {There is a striking disparity between the heart-shaped structure of human serum albumin (HSA) observed in single crystals and the elongated ellipsoid model used for decades to interpret the protein solution hydrodynamics at neutral pH. These two contrasting views could be reconciled if the protein were flexible enough to change its conformation in solution from that found in the crystal. To investigate this possibility we recorded the rotational motions in real time of an erythrosin-bovine serum albumin complex (Er-BSA) over an extended time range, using phosphorescence depolarization techniques. These measurements are consistent with the absence of independent motions of large protein segments in solution, in the time range from nanoseconds to fractions of milliseconds, and give a single rotational correlation time phi(BSA, 1 cP, 20 degrees C) = 40 +/- 2 ns. In addition, we report a detailed analysis of the protein hydrodynamics based on two bead-modeling methods. In the first, BSA was modeled as a triangular prismatic shell with optimized dimensions of 84 x 84 x 84 x 31.5 A, whereas in the second, the atomic-level structure of HSA obtained from crystallographic data was used to build a much more refined rough-shell model. In both cases, the predicted and experimental rotational diffusion rate and other hydrodynamic parameters were in good agreement. Therefore, the overall conformation in neutral solution of BSA, as of HSA, should be rigid, in the sense indicated above, and very similar to the heart-shaped structure observed in HSA crystals.},

This strategy is suited for small data sets and is a complementary method to bootstrap methods. rdCV is a formal, partly new combination of known procedures and methods, and has been implemented in a function for the programming environment R, providing several types of plots for model evaluation. The current version of the software is dedicated to regression models obtained by partial least-squares (PLS). The applied methods for repeated splits of the data into test sets and calibration sets, as well as for estimation of the optimum number of PLS components, are described. The relevance of some parameters (number of segments in CV, number of repetitions) is investigated. rdCV is applied to two data sets from chemistry: (1) determination of glucose concentrations from near infrared (NIR) data in mash samples from bioethanol production; (2) modeling the gas chromatographic retention indices of polycyclic aromatic compounds from molecular descriptors. Models using all original variables and models using a small subset of the variables, selected by a genetic algorithm (GA), are compared by rdCV. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {NMR spectroscopy remains one of the primary analytical approaches in metabolomics. Although 1D (1)H NMR spectroscopy is versatile, highly reproducible and currently the most widely used technique in NMR metabolomics, analysis of complex biological samples typically yields highly congested spectra with severely overlapping signals making unambiguous metabolite identification and quantification almost impossible. Consequently there is a growing use of 2D NMR methods, in particular (1)H J-resolved (JRES) spectroscopy, which spreads the high signal density into a second dimension. One potentially powerful method to deconvolute these JRES spectra, facilitating metabolite quantification, is via line-shape fitting. However, the mathematical functions describing the JRES NMR line-shape, in particular after applying apodisation functions and JRES specific processing, including tilting and symmetrisation, remain uncharacterised. Furthermore, possible quantitation errors arising from processing JRES spectra have not been evaluated, nor have the potentially adverse quantitative effects of overlapping dispersive tails of closely spaced signals in the 2D spectrum. Here we address these issues and evaluate the suitability of the JRES experiment for accurate complex mixture analysis. Specifically, we have examined changes in NMR line-shape and signal intensity after application of different apodisation functions (SINE and SEM) and JRES specific processing (tilting and symmetrising), comparing simulated and experimental data. We also report a significant quantitation error of up to 33\%, dependent upon apodisation, due to overlap of the dispersive tails of closely spaced resonances. Finally, we have validated the use of these mathematical line-shape functions for metabolite quantitation of 2D JRES spectra, by comparison to corresponding 1D NMR datasets, using both gravimetrically-prepared chemically defined mixtures as well as biological tissue extracts.},

abstract = {Nanometer-scale structuring in room-temperature ionic liquids is observed using molecular simulation. The ionic liquids studied belong to the 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium family with hexafluorophosphate or with bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)amide as the anions, [C(n)mim][PF(6)] or [C(n)mim][(CF(3)SO(2))(2)N], respectively. They were represented, for the first time in a simulation study focusing on long-range structures, by an all-atom force field of the AMBER/OPLS\_AA family containing parameters developed specifically for these compounds. For ionic liquids with alkyl side chains longer than or equal to C(4), aggregation of the alkyl chains in nonpolar domains is observed. These domains permeate a tridimensional network of ionic channels formed by anions and by the imidazolium rings of the cations. The nanostructures can be visualized in a conspicuous way simply by color coding the two types of domains (in this work, we chose red = polar and green = nonpolar). As the length of the alkyl chain increases, the nonpolar domains become larger and more connected and cause swelling of the ionic network, in a manner analogous to systems exhibiting microphase separation. The consequences of these nanostructural features on the properties of the ionic liquids are analyzed.},

@article{Sayrin2011,
abstract = {Feedback loops are central to most classical control procedures. A controller compares the signal measured by a sensor (system output) with the target value or set-point. It then adjusts an actuator (system input) to stabilize the signal around the target value. Generalizing this scheme to stabilize a micro-system's quantum state relies on quantum feedback, which must overcome a fundamental difficulty: the sensor measurements cause a random back-action on the system. An optimal compromise uses weak measurements, providing partial information with minimal perturbation. The controller should include the effect of this perturbation in the computation of the actuator's operation, which brings the incrementally perturbed state closer to the target. Although some aspects of this scenario have been experimentally demonstrated for the control of quantum or classical micro-system variables, continuous feedback loop operations that permanently stabilize quantum systems around a target state have not yet been realized. Here we have implemented such a real-time stabilizing quantum feedback scheme following a method inspired by ref. 13. It prepares on demand photon number states (Fock states) of a microwave field in a superconducting cavity, and subsequently reverses the effects of decoherence-induced field quantum jumps. The sensor is a beam of atoms crossing the cavity, which repeatedly performs weak quantum non-demolition measurements of the photon number. The controller is implemented in a real-time computer commanding the actuator, which injects adjusted small classical fields into the cavity between measurements. The microwave field is a quantum oscillator usable as a quantum memory or as a quantum bus swapping information between atoms. Our experiment demonstrates that active control can generate non-classical states of this oscillator and combat their decoherence, and is a significant step towards the implementation of complex quantum information operations.},

Sample preparation included solid-phase extraction of both analytes and their derivatization with heptafluorobutyric anhydride (HFBA). Protriptyline was used as internal standard for the determination of both analytes. Limits of detection and quantification for both sertraline and desmethyl-sertraline were 0.30 and 1.00??g/L, respectively. The calibration curves were linear within the dynamic range of each analyte (1.00-500.0??g/L) with a correlation coefficient (R 2) exceeding 0.991. Extraction efficiency ranged from 90.1(??5.8)\% to 95.4(??3.0)\% for sertraline, and from 84.9(??8.2)\% to 107.7(??4.4)\% for desmethyl-sertraline. The precision for sertraline and desmethyl-sertraline was between 3.6-5.5\% and 4.7-7.2\%, respectively, while the accuracy was in the range of -6.67\% to 2.20\% and -6.33\% to 2.88\% for sertraline and desmethyl-sertraline, respectively. The method was applied to real blood samples obtained from patients that follow sertraline treatment and also in cases of forensic interest. The developed method can be used in routine every day analysis by clinical and forensic laboratories, for pharmacokinetic studies, for therapeutic sertraline monitoring or for the investigation of forensic cases where sertraline is involved. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {We present an analytical algorithm using fast Fourier transformations (FTs) for deriving the gradient needed as part of the iterative reconstruction of sparsely sampled datasets using the forward maximum entropy reconstruction (FM) procedure by Hyberts and Wagner [J. Am. Chem. Soc. 129 (2007) 5108]. The major drawback of the original algorithm is that it required one FT and one evaluation of the entropy per missing datapoint to establish the gradient. In the present study, we demonstrate that the entire gradient may be obtained using only two FT's and one evaluation of the entropy derivative, thus achieving impressive time savings compared to the original procedure. An example: A 2D dataset with sparse sampling of the indirect dimension, with sampling of only 75 out of 512 complex points (15\% sampling) would lack (512 - 75) ?? 2 = 874 points per ??2 slice. The original FM algorithm would require 874 FT's and entropy function evaluations to setup the gradient, while the present algorithm is ???450 times faster in this case, since it requires only two FT's. This allows reduction of the computational time from several hours to less than a minute. Even more impressive time savings may be achieved with 2D reconstructions of 3D datasets, where the original algorithm required days of CPU time on high-performance computing clusters only require few minutes of calculation on regular laptop computers with the new algorithm. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.

When all the distances between n points are known a method is derived which finds their co-ordinates referred to principal axes. A set of necessary and sufficient conditions for a solution to exist in real Euclidean sapce is found. Q and R techniques are defined as being dual to one another when they both lead to a set of n points with the same inter-point distances. Pairs of dual techniques are derived.

The effects of zero-filling and apodization are examined for free-induction-decay (FID) signals and for symmetric spin-echo signals in one and two dimensions, with particular attention to features not previously presented in the literature. Findings suggest that for mild apodization, the known sensitivity enhancement due to zero-filling in either the real or the imaginary part signal [E. Bartholdi, R.R. Ernst, Fourier spectroscopy and the causality principle, J. Magn. Reson., 11 (1973) 9-19] is maintained; however, for stronger apodization filters, this enhancement can be obliterated completely. It is shown that results obtained by analysis of one-dimensional signals can be readily applied to multi-dimensional data.

If the exact number of lines contributing to the overlapping spectral region is not known, a corresponding error makes the result less precise. The uncertainty about the number of contributing resonances can be reduced with experiments that discriminate different classes of resonances by filtering techniques or by extending PULCON to two-dimensional NMR spectra. We demonstrate the application of PULCON with a 1D 15N-filtered experiment where aromatic resonances of a protein can be observed without interference from 15N-bound protons. Further, we extend PULCON to 2D NMR spectra that permits to determine the exact number of resonances. This extension can readily be applied with sample that contain different solutes.},

abstract = {Different decoupling sequences are tested-using various shaped radio-frequency (RF) pulses-to achieve the longest possible lifetimes of singlet-state populations over the widest possible bandwidths, that is, ranges of offsets and relative chemical shifts of the nuclei involved in the singlet states. The use of sinc or refocusing broadband universal rotation pulses (RE-BURP) for decoupling during the intervals where singlet-state populations are preserved allows one to extend the useful bandwidth with respect to prior state-of-the-art methods based on composite-pulse WALTZ decoupling. The improved sinc decoupling sequences afford a more reliable and sensitive measure of the lifetimes of singlet states in pairs of spins that have widely different chemical shifts, such as the two aromatic protons H(5) and H(6) in uracil. Similar advantages are expected for nucleotides in RNA and DNA. Alternative approaches, in particular frequency-modulated decoupling sequences, also appear to be effective in preserving singlet-state populations, even though the profiles of the apparent relaxation rate constants as a function of the offset are somewhat perturbed. The best decoupling sequences prove their utility in sustaining longer lifetimes of singlet states than previously achieved for the side-chain tyrosine protons in bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) at 600 MHz (14.1 T), where the differences of chemical shifts between coupled protons are a challenge.},

abstract = {The use of generous distance bounds has been the hallmark of NMR structure determination. However, bounds necessitate the estimation of data quality before the calculation, reduce the information content, introduce human bias, and allow for major errors in the structures. Here, we propose a new rapid structure calculation scheme based on Bayesian analysis. The minimization of an extended energy function, including a new type of distance restraint and a term depending on the data quality, results in an estimation of the data quality in addition to coordinates. This allows for the determination of the optimal weight on the experimental information. The resulting structures are of better quality and closer to the X-ray crystal structure of the same molecule. With the new calculation approach, the analysis of discrepancies from the target distances becomes meaningful. The strategy may be useful in other applications-for example, in homology modeling. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In our modern 'omics era, metabolic flux analysis (fluxomics) represents the physiological counterpart of its siblings transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics. Fluxomics integrates in vivo measurements of metabolic fluxes with stoichiometric network models to allow the determination of absolute flux through large networks of the central carbon metabolism. There are many approaches to implement fluxomics including flux balance analysis (FBA), (13) C fluxomics and (13) C-constrained FBA as well as many experimental settings for flux measurement including dynamic, stationary and semi-stationary. Here we outline the principles of the different approaches and their relative advantages. We demonstrate the unique contribution of flux analysis for phenotype elucidation using a thoroughly studied metabolic reaction as a case study, the microbial aerobic/anaerobic shift, highlighting the importance of flux analysis as a single layer of data as well as interlaced in multi-omics studies.},

abstract = {Hydrogen bonds between backbone amides are common in folded proteins. Here, we show that an intimate interaction between backbone amides also arises from the delocalization of a lone pair of electrons (n) from an oxygen atom to the antibonding orbital (pi*) of the subsequent carbonyl group. Natural bond orbital analysis predicted significant n-->pi* interactions in certain regions of the Ramachandran plot. These predictions were validated by a statistical analysis of a large, non-redundant subset of protein structures determined to high resolution. The correlation between these two independent studies is striking. Moreover, the n-->pi* interactions are abundant and especially prevalent in common secondary structures such as alpha-, 3(10)- and polyproline II helices and twisted beta-sheets. In addition to their evident effects on protein structure and stability, n-->pi* interactions could have important roles in protein folding and function, and merit inclusion in computational force fields.},

abstract = {Simple, effective protocols have been developed for manual and machine-assisted Boc-chemistry solid phase peptide synthesis on polystyrene resins. These use in situ neutralization [i.e. neutralization simultaneous with coupling], high concentrations (> 0.2 M) of Boc-amino acid-OBt esters plus base for rapid coupling, 100\% TFA for rapid Boc group removal, and a single short (30 s) DMF flow wash between deprotection/coupling and between coupling/deprotection. Single 10 min coupling times were used throughout. Overall cycle times were 15 min for manual and 19 min for machine-assisted synthesis (75 residues per day). No racemization was detected in the base-catalyzed coupling step. Several side reactions were studied, and eliminated. These included: pyrrolidonecarboxylic acid formation from Gln in hot TFA-DMF; chain-termination by reaction with excess HBTU; and, chain termination by acetylation (from HOAc in commercial Boc-amino acids). The in situ neutralization protocols gave a significant increase in the efficiency of chain assembly, especially for "difficult" sequences arising from sequence-dependent peptide chain aggregation in standard (neutralization prior to coupling) Boc-chemistry SPPS protocols or in Fmoc-chemistry SPPS. Reported syntheses include HIV-1 protease(1-50,Cys.amide), HIV-1 protease(53-99), and the full length HIV-1 protease(1-99).},

abstract = {Quantitative one-dimensional (1D) 1H NMR spectroscopy is a useful tool for determining metabolite concentrations because of the direct proportionality of signal intensity to the quantity of analyte. However, severe signal overlap in 1D 1H NMR spectra of complex metabolite mixtures hinders accurate quantification. Extension of 1D 1H to 2D 1H−13C HSQC leads to the dispersion of peaks along the 13C dimension and greatly alleviates peak overlapping. Although peaks are better resolved in 2D 1H−13C HSQC than in 1D 1H NMR spectra, the simple proportionality of cross peaks to the quantity of individual metabolites is lost by resonance-specific signal attenuation during the coherence transfer periods. As a result, peaks for individual metabolites usually are quantified by reference to calibration data collected from samples of known concentration. We show here that data from a series of HSQC spectra acquired with incremented repetition times (the time between the end of the first 1H excitation pulse to the beginning of data acquisition) can be extrapolated back to zero time to yield a time-zero 2D 1H−13C HSQC spectrum (HSQC) in which signal intensities are proportional to concentrations of individual metabolites. Relative concentrations determined from cross peak intensities can be converted to absolute concentrations by reference to an internal standard of known concentration. Clustering of the HSQC cross peaks by their normalized intensities identifies those corresponding to metabolites present at a given concentration, and this information can assist in assigning these peaks to specific compounds. The concentration measurement for an individual metabolite can be improved by averaging the intensities of multiple, nonoverlapping cross peaks assigned to that metabolite.},

abstract = {Water suppression is typically performed in vivo by exciting the longitudinal magnetization in combination with dephasing, or by using frequency-selective coherence generation. MEGA, a frequency-selective refocusing technique, can be placed into any pulse sequence element designed to generate a Hahn spin-echo or stimulated echo, to dephase transverse water coherences with minimal spectral distortions. Water suppression performance was verified in vivo using stimulated echo acquisition mode (STEAM) localization, which provided water suppression comparable with that achieved with four selective pulses in 3,1-DRYSTEAM. The advantage of the proposed method was exploited for editing J-coupled resonances. Using a double-banded pulse that selectively inverts a J-coupling partner and simultaneously suppresses water, efficient metabolite editing was achieved in the point resolved spectroscopy (PRESS) and STEAM sequences in which MEGA was incorporated. To illustrate the efficiency of the method, the detection of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) was demonstrated, with minimal contributions from macromolecules and overlying singlet peaks at 4 T. The estimated occipital GABA concentration was consistent with previous reports, suggesting that editing for GABA is efficient when based on MEGA at high field strengths.},

abstract = {Principal component analysis (PCA) is routinely applied to the study of NMR based metabolomic data. PCA is used to simplify the examination of complex metabolite mixtures obtained from biological samples that may be composed of hundreds or thousands of chemical components. PCA is primarily used to identify relative changes in the concentration of metabolites to identify trends or characteristics within the NMR data that permits discrimination between various samples that differ in their source or treatment. A common concern with PCA of NMR data is the potential over emphasis of small changes in high concentration metabolites that would over-shadow significant and large changes in low-concentration components that may lead to a skewed or irrelevant clustering of the NMR data. We have identified an additional concern, very small and random fluctuations within the noise of the NMR spectrum can also result in large and irrelevant variations in the PCA clustering. Alleviation of this problem is obtained by simply excluding the noise region from the PCA by a judicious choice of a threshold above the spectral noise. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Normal Raman spectroscopy was evaluated as a metabolomic tool for assessing the impacts of exposure to environmental contaminants, using rat urine collected during the course of a toxicological study. Specifically, one of three triazole fungicides, myclobutanil, propiconazole, or triadimefon, was administered daily via oral gavage to male Sprague-Dawley rats at doses of 300, 300, or 175 mg/kg, respectively. Urine was collected from all three treatment groups and also from vehicle control rats on day six, following five consecutive days of exposure. Spectra were acquired with a CCD-based dispersive Raman spectrometer, using 785-nm diode laser excitation. To optimize the signal-to-noise ratio, urine samples were filtered through a stirred ultrafiltration cell with a 500 nominal molecular weight limit filter to remove large, unwanted urine components that can degrade the spectrum via fluorescence. However, a subsequent investigation suggested that suitable spectra can be obtained in a high-throughput fashion, with little or no Raman-specific sample preparation. For the sake of comparison, a parallel 1H NMR-based metabolomic analysis was also conducted on the unfiltered samples. Results from multivariate data analysis demonstrated that the Raman method compares favorably with NMR in regard to the ability to differentiate responses from these three contaminants.},

Our system clearly rules out the possibility of formation of any intermediate reaction product in a so-called fast ionic reaction between sodium hydroxide and phenolphthalein, and reveals a microsecond time scale associated with the formation of the reaction product. We have also used the developed system for the investigation of intermediate states in the molecular recognition of various macromolecular self-assemblies (micelles) and genomic DNA by small organic ligands (Hoechst 33258 and ethidium bromide).

A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is widely used for high-throughput characterization of metabolites in complex biological mixtures. However, accurate interpretation of the spectra in terms of identities and abundances of metabolites can be challenging, in particular in crowded regions with heavy peak overlap. Although a number of computational approaches for this task have recently been proposed, they are not entirely satisfactory in either accuracy or extent of automation. RESULTS: We introduce a probabilistic approach Bayesian Quantification (BQuant), for fully automated database-based identification and quantification of metabolites in local regions of (1)H NMR spectra. The approach represents the spectra as mixtures of reference profiles from a database, and infers the identities and the abundances of metabolites by Bayesian model selection. We show using a simulated dataset, a spike-in experiment and a metabolomic investigation of plasma samples that BQuant outperforms the available automated alternatives in accuracy for both identification and quantification.

Configurational entropies determined in dihedral angle space for each amino acid type are accurately parametrized in terms of arithmetically-averaged order parameters of selected N-H, C-H, and C-CH(3) vectors that are accessible by NMR spectroscopy. The resulting amino acid-specific relationships have high accuracy and provide a simple dictionary for the quantitative conversion of experimental NMR S(2) order parameters into the total configurational entropy and its changes.

abstract = {[Figure: see text]. Most chemical processes on earth are intimately linked to the unique properties of water, relying on the versatility with which water interacts with molecules of varying sizes and polarities. These interactions determine everything from the structure and activity of proteins and living cells to the geological partitioning of water, oil, and minerals in the Earth's crust. The role of hydrophobic hydration in the formation of biological membranes and in protein folding, as well as the importance of electrostatic interactions in the hydration of polar and ionic species, are all well known. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of hydration are often not as well understood. This Account summarizes and extends emerging understandings of these mechanisms to reveal a newly unified view of hydration and explain previously mystifying observations. For example, rare gas atoms (e.g., Ar) and alkali-halide ions (e.g., K+ and Cl-) have nearly identical experimental hydration entropies, despite the significant charge-induced reorganization of water molecules. Here, we explain how such previously mysterious observations may be understood as arising from Gibbs inequalities, which impose rigorous energetic upper and lower bounds on both hydration free energies and entropies. These fundamental Gibbs bounds depend only on the average interaction energy of a solute with water, thus providing a deep link between solute-water interaction energies and entropies. One of the surprising consequences of the emerging picture is the understanding that the hydration of an ion produces two large but nearly perfectly cancelling, entropic contributions: a negative ion-water interaction entropy and a positive water reorganization entropy. Recent work has also clarified the relationship between the strong cohesive energy of water and the free energy required to form an empty hole (cavity) in water. Here, we explain how linear response theory (whose roots may also be traced to Gibbs inequalities) can provide remarkably accurate descriptions of the process of filling aqueous cavities with nonpolar, polar, or charged molecules. The hydration of nonpolar molecules is well-described by first-order perturbation theory, which implies that turning on solute-water van der Waals interactions does not induce a significant change in water structure. The larger changes in water structure that are induced by polar and ionic solutes are well-described by second-order perturbation theory, which is equivalent to linear response theory. Comparisons of the free energies of nonpolar and polar or ionic solutes may be used to experimentally determine electrostatic contributions to water reorganization energies and entropies. The success of this approach implies that water's ability to respond to solutes of various polarities is far from saturated, as illustrated by simulations of acetonitrile (CH 3CN) in water, which reveal that even such a strongly dipolar solute only produces subtle changes in the structure of water.},

abstract = {Recently developed methods to measure distances in proteins with high accuracy by "exact" nuclear Overhauser effects (eNOEs) make it possible to determine stereospecific assignments, which are particularly important to fully exploit the accuracy of the eNOE distance measurements. Stereospecific assignments are determined by comparing the eNOE-derived distances to protein structure bundles calculated without stereospecific assignments, or an independently determined crystal structure. The absolute and relative CYANA target function difference upon swapping the stereospecific assignment of a diastereotopic group yields the respective stereospecific assignment. We applied the method to the eNOE data set that has recently been obtained for the third immunoglobulin-binding domain of protein G (GB3). The 884 eNOEs provide relevant data for 47 of the total of 75 diastereotopic groups. Stereospecific assignments could be established for 45 diastereotopic groups (96 \%) using the X-ray structure, or for 27 diastereotopic groups (57 \%) using structures calculated with the eNOE data set without stereospecific assignments, all of which are in agreement with those determined previously. The latter case is relevant for structure determinations based on eNOEs. The accuracy of the eNOE distance measurements is crucial for making stereospecific assignments because applying the same method to the traditional NOE data set for GB3 with imprecise upper distance bounds yields only 13 correct stereospecific assignments using the X-ray structure or 2 correct stereospecific assignments using NMR structures calculated without stereospecific assignments.},

@article{Abbas2013,
abstract = {A common issue in bioinformatics is that computational methods often generate a large number of predictions sorted according to certain confidence scores. A key problem is then determining how many predictions must be selected to include most of the true predictions while maintaining reasonably high precision. In nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based protein structure determination, for instance, computational peak picking methods are becoming more and more common, although expert-knowledge remains the method of choice to determine how many peaks among thousands of candidate peaks should be taken into consideration to capture the true peaks. Here, we propose a Benjamini-Hochberg (B-H)-based approach that automatically selects the number of peaks. We formulate the peak selection problem as a multiple testing problem. Given a candidate peak list sorted by either volumes or intensities, we first convert the peaks into [Formula: see text]-values and then apply the B-H-based algorithm to automatically select the number of peaks. The proposed approach is tested on the state-of-the-art peak picking methods, including WaVPeak [1] and PICKY [2]. Compared with the traditional fixed number-based approach, our approach returns significantly more true peaks. For instance, by combining WaVPeak or PICKY with the proposed method, the missing peak rates are on average reduced by 20\% and 26\%, respectively, in a benchmark set of 32 spectra extracted from eight proteins. The consensus of the B-H-selected peaks from both WaVPeak and PICKY achieves 88\% recall and 83\% precision, which significantly outperforms each individual method and the consensus method without using the B-H algorithm. The proposed method can be used as a standard procedure for any peak picking method and straightforwardly applied to some other prediction selection problems in bioinformatics. The source code, documentation and example data of the proposed method is available at http://sfb.kaust.edu.sa/pages/software.aspx.},

abstract = {Pattern recognition techniques are effective tools for reducing the information contained in large spectral data sets to a much smaller number of significant features which can then be used to make interpretations about the chemical or biochemical system under study. Often the effectiveness of such approaches is impeded by experimental and instrument induced variations in the position, phase, and line width of the spectral peaks. Although characterizing the cause and magnitude of these fluctuations could be important in its own right (pH-induced NMR chemical shift changes, for example) in general they obscure the process of pattern discovery. One major area of application is the use of large databases of 1H NMR spectra of biofluids such as urine for investigating perturbations in metabolic profiles caused by drugs or disease, a process now termed metabonomics. Frequency shifts of individual peaks are the dominant source of such unwanted variations in this type of data. In this paper, an automatic procedure for aligning the individual peaks in the data set is described and evaluated. The proposed method will be vital for the efficient and automatic analysis of large metabonomic data sets and should also be applicable to other types of data. ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Use of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabonomics to search for human disease biomarkers is becoming increasingly common. For many researchers, the ultimate goal is translation from biomarker discovery to clinical application. Studies typically involve investigators from diverse educational and training backgrounds, including physicians, academic researchers, and clinical staff. In evaluating potential biomarkers, clinicians routinely use statistical significance testing language, whereas academicians typically use multivariate statistical analysis techniques that do not perform statistical significance evaluation. In this article, we outline an approach to integrate statistical significance testing with conventional principal components analysis data representation. A decision tree algorithm is introduced to select and apply appropriate statistical tests to loadings plot data, which are then heat map color-coded according to P score, enabling direct visual assessment of statistical significance. A multiple comparisons correction must be applied to determine P scores from which reliable inferences can be made. Knowledge of means and standard deviations of statistically significant buckets enabled computation of effect sizes and study sizes for a given statistical power. Methods were demonstrated using data from a previous study. Integrated metabonomics data assessment methodology should facilitate translation of NMR-based metabonomics discovery of human disease biomarkers to clinical use. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {In order to clarify the mechanism of denaturant-induced unfolding of proteins we have calculated the interactions between hydrophobic and ionic species in aqueous guanidinium chloride and urea solutions using molecular dynamics simulations. Hydrophobic association is not significantly changed in urea or guanidinium chloride solutions. The strength of interaction between ion pairs is greatly diminished by the guanidinium ion. Although the changes in electrostatic interactions in urea are small, examination of structures, using appropriate pair functions, of urea and water around the solutes show strong hydrogen bonding between urea's carbonyl oxygen and the positively charged solute. Our results strongly suggest protein denaturation occurs by the direct interaction model according to which the most commonly used denaturants unfold proteins by altering electrostatic interactions either by solvating the charged residues or by engaging in hydrogen bonds with the protein backbone. To further validate the direct interaction model we show that, in urea and guanidinium chloride solutions, unfolding of an unusually stable helix (H1) from mouse PrPC (residues 144-153) occurs by hydrogen bonding of denaturants to charged side chains and backbone carbonyl groups.},

Their standard processing involves a regular FFT of the projections followed by a reconstruction, i.e. a non-linear process. In this communication, we show that a 2D discrete Fourier transform can be implemented in polar coordinates to obtain directly a frequency domain spectrum. Aliasing due to local violations of the Nyquist sampling theorem gives rise to base line ridges but the peak line-shapes are not distorted as in most reconstruction methods. The sampling scheme is not linear and the data points in the time domain should thus be weighted accordingly in the polar FT; however, artifacts can be reduced by additional data weighting of the undersampled regions. This processing does not require any parameter tuning and is straightforward to use. The algorithm written for polar sampling can be adapted to any sampling scheme and will permit to investigate better compromises in terms of experimental time and lack of artifacts.},

Comparing protein processes with the dielectric fluctuations of the surrounding solvent shows that they fall into two classes: nonslaved and slaved. Nonslaved processes are independent of the solvent motions; their rates are determined by the protein conformation and vibrational dynamics. Slaved processes are tightly coupled to the solvent; their rates have approximately the same temperature dependence as the rate of the solvent fluctuations, but they are smaller. Because the temperature dependence is determined by the activation enthalpy, we propose that the solvent is responsible for the activation enthalpy, whereas the protein and the hydration shell control the activation entropy through the energy landscape. Bond formation is the prototype of nonslaved processes; opening and closing of channels are quintessential slaved motions. The prevalence of slaved motions highlights the importance of the environment in cells and membranes for the function of proteins.},

Remarkably, in opposition to common least-squares approaches, the proposed approximation scheme does not rely on partial derivatives, and furthermore, the runtime is independent to the number of spectral datapoints. Simulations provide promising empirical evidence for successful peak selection and parameter approximation, with the results for the latter highly outperforming the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm in terms of error minimization and robustness.},

abstract = {We seek to understand the link between protein thermodynamics and protein structure in molecular detail. A classical approach to this problem involves assessing changes in protein stability resulting from added cosolvents. Under any given conditions, protein molecules in aqueous buffer are in equilibrium between unfolded and folded states, U(nfolded) <==> N(ative). Addition of organic osmolytes, small uncharged compounds found throughout nature, shift this equilibrium. Urea, a denaturing osmolyte, shifts the equilibrium toward U; trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), a protecting osmolyte, shifts the equilibrium toward N. Using the Tanford Transfer Model, the thermodynamic response to many such osmolytes has been dissected into groupwise free energy contributions. It is found that the energetics involving backbone hydrogen bonding controls these shifts in protein stability almost entirely, with osmolyte cosolvents simply dialing between solvent-backbone versus backbone-backbone hydrogen bonds, as a function of solvent quality. This reciprocal relationship establishes the essential link between protein thermodynamics and the protein's hydrogen-bonded backbone structure.},

abstract = {Physical exercise induces a network of alterations in the transcriptome and proteome of the skeletal muscle, resulting in modifications of the muscle physiology. Intriguingly, exercise also transiently induces the production of both reactive oxygen species (ROS) and some inflammatory cytokines in skeletal muscle. In fact, it seems that exercise-induced ROS are able to stimulate cytokine production from skeletal muscle. Despite the initial view that ROS were potentially cell damaging, it now seems possible that these substances have important roles in the regulation of cell signaling. Muscle-derived cytokines, so-called 'myokines', are distinguished from inflammation and instead possess important anti-inflammatory and metabolic properties. In this opinion piece, we suggest that both ROS and myokines are important players in muscle adaptation to exercise. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

This problem has in fact been studied by many authors and we give a summary of their treatments. We then criticize the main conclusion of these treatments; viz., that in a measurement of energy carried out in a time interval, $\Delta$t, there must be a minimum uncertainty in the transfer of energy to the observed system, given by $\Delta$(E′-E)>\~{}h/$\Delta$t. We show that this conclusion is erroneous in two respects. First, it is not consistent with the general principles of the quantum theory, which require that all uncertainty relations be expressible in terms of the mathematical formalism, i.e., by means of operators, wave functions, etc. Secondly, the examples of measurement processes that were used to derive the above uncertainty relation are not general enough. We then develop a systematic presentation of our own point of view, with regard to the role of time in the quantum theory, and give a concrete example of a measurement process not satisfying the above uncertainty relation.},

abstract = {Omics approaches have proven their value to provide a broad monitoring of biological systems. However, as no single analytical technique is sufficient to reveal the full biochemical content of complex biological matrices or biofluids, the fusion of information from several data sources has become a decisive issue. Omics studies generate an increasing amount of massive data obtained from different analytical devices. These data are usually high dimensional and extracting knowledge from these multiple blocks is challenging. Appropriate tools are therefore needed to handle these datasets suitably. For that purpose, a generic methodology is proposed by combining the strengths of established data analysis strategies, i.e. multiple kernel learning and OPLS-DA to offer an efficient tool for the fusion of Omics data obtained from multiple sources. Three real case studies are proposed to assess the potential of the method. A first example illustrates the fusion of mass spectrometry-based metabolomic data acquired in both negative and positive electrospray ionisation modes, from leaf samples of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. A second dataset involves the classification of wine grape varieties based on polyphenolic extracts analysed by two-dimensional heteronuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. A third case study underlines the ability of the method to combine heterogeneous data from systems biology with the analysis of publicly available data related to NCI-60 cancer cell lines from different tissue origins, which include metabolomics, transcriptomics and proteomics.The fusion of Omics data from different sources is expected to provide a more complete view of biological systems. The proposed method was demonstrated as a relevant and widely applicable alternative to handle efficiently the inherent characteristics of multiple Omics data, such as very large numbers of noisy collinear variables. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Currently, no standard metrics are used to quantify cluster separation in PCA or PLS-DA scores plots for metabonomics studies or to determine if cluster separation is statistically significant. Lack of such measures makes it virtually impossible to compare independent or inter-laboratory studies and can lead to confusion in the metabonomics literature when authors putatively identify metabolites distinguishing classes of samples based on visual and qualitative inspection of scores plots that exhibit marginal separation. While previous papers have addressed quantification of cluster separation in PCA scores plots, none have advocated routine use of a quantitative measure of separation that is supported by a standard and rigorous assessment of whether or not the cluster separation is statistically significant. Here quantification and statistical significance of separation of group centroids in PCA and PLS-DA scores plots are considered. The Mahalanobis distance is used to quantify the distance between group centroids, and the two-sample Hotelling's T
                        2 test is computed for the data, related to an F-statistic, and then an F-test is applied to determine if the cluster separation is statistically significant. We demonstrate the value of this approach using four datasets containing various degrees of separation, ranging from groups that had no apparent visual cluster separation to groups that had no visual cluster overlap. Widespread adoption of such concrete metrics to quantify and evaluate the statistical significance of PCA and PLS-DA cluster separation would help standardize reporting of metabonomics data. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Chemical shift perturbations (CSPs) in NMR spectra provide useful information about the interaction of a protein with its ligands. However, in a multiple-ligand-binding system, determining quantitative parameters such as a dissociation constant (K(d) ) is difficult. Here, we used a method we named CS-PCA, a principal component analysis (PCA) of chemical shift (CS) data, to analyze the interaction between bovine $\beta$-lactoglobulin ($\beta$LG) and 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonate (ANS), which is a multiple-ligand-binding system. The CSP on the binding of ANS involved contributions from two distinct binding sites. PCA of the titration data successfully separated the CSP pattern into contributions from each site. Docking simulations based on the separated CSP patterns provided the structures of $\beta$LG-ANS complexes for each binding site. In addition, we determined the K(d) values as 3.42 × 10⁻⁴ M² and 2.51 × 10⁻³ M for Sites 1 and 2, respectively. In contrast, it was difficult to obtain reliable K(d) values for respective sites from the isothermal titration calorimetry experiments. Two ANS molecules were found to bind at Site 1 simultaneously, suggesting that the binding occurs cooperatively with a partial unfolding of the $\beta$LG structure. On the other hand, the binding of ANS to Site 2 was a simple attachment without a significant conformational change. From the present results, CS-PCA was confirmed to provide not only the positions and the K(d) values of binding sites but also information about the binding mechanism. Thus, it is anticipated to be a general method to investigate protein-ligand interactions.},

Unlike the leave-one-out procedure widely used in chemometrics for cross-validation (CV), the Monte Carlo cross-validation developed in this paper is an asymptotically consistent method of model selection. It can avoid an unnecessarily large model and therefore decreases the risk of overfitting of the model. The results obtained from a simulation study showed that MCCV has an obviously larger probability than leave-one-out CV (LOO-CV) of selecting the model with best prediction ability and that a corrected MCCV (CMCCV) could give a more accurate estimation of prediction ability than LOO-CV or MCCV. The results obtained with real data sets demonstrated that MCCV could successfully select an appropriate model and that CMCCV could assess the prediction ability of the selected model with satisfactory accuracy.

Through the combined use of stable isotope tracers and chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry, our computational analysis enables the quantitative detection of all measurable metabolites derived from a specific labeled compound. Without a priori knowledge of a reaction network or compound library, NTFD provides information about relative flux magnitudes into each metabolite pool by determining the mass isotopomer distribution for all labeled compounds. This novel method adds a new dimension to the metabolomics tool box and provides a framework for global analysis of metabolic fluxes.},

Through the application of pattern recognition and classification algorithms, the data have been shown to provide information on disease diagnosis and the beneficial and adverse effects of potential therapeutics. Here, a novel approach is described for identifying subsets of spectral patterns in databases of NMR spectra, and it is shown that the intensities of these spectral patterns can be related to the onset and recovery from a toxic lesion in both a time-related and dose-related fashion. These patterns form a new type of combination biomarker for the biological effect under study. The approach is illustrated with a study of liver toxicity in rats using NMR spectra of urine following administration of a model hepatotoxin hydrazine.},

abstract = {Application of band-selective homonuclear (BASH) 1H decoupling pulses during acquisition of the 1H free induction decay is shown to be an efficient procedure for removal of scalar and residual dipolar couplings between amide and aliphatic protons. BASH decoupling can be applied in both dimensions of a homonuclear 2D NMR experiment and is particularly useful for enhancing spectral resolution in the HN-H$\alpha$ region of NOESY spectra of peptides and proteins, which contain important information on the backbone torsion angles. The method then also prevents generation of zero quantum and HzN-Hz$\alpha$ terms, thereby facilitating analysis of intraresidue interactions. Application to the NOESY spectrum of a hexapeptide fragment of the intrinsically disordered protein $\alpha$-synuclein highlights the considerable diffusion anisotropy present in linear peptides. Removal of residual dipolar couplings between HN and aliphatic protons in weakly aligned proteins increases resolution in the 1H-15N HSQC region of the spectrum and allows measurement of RDCs in samples that are relatively strongly aligned. The approach is demonstrated for measurement of RDCs in protonated 15N/13C-enriched ubiquitin, aligned in Pf1, yielding improved fitting to the ubiquitin structure. © Published by Elsevier Inc.},

Electrocatalysis using a weak acid (4-tert-butylphenol, pKa = 27.5 in acetonitrile) is observed for each catalyst with similar overpotential. The enhanced stability of the reduction products of 3 leads to a modest increase of the apparent catalytic rate.

The ability to parse protein chains into different domains is important for protein classification and for understanding protein structure, function, and evolution.

DOMpro predicts protein domains using a combination of evolutionary information in the form of profiles, predicted secondary structure, and predicted relative solvent accessibility. DOMpro is trained and tested on a curated dataset derived from the CATH database. DOMpro correctly predicts the number of domains for 69\% of the combined dataset of single and multi-domain chains. DOMpro achieves a sensitivity of 76\% and specificity of 85\% with respect to the single-domain proteins and sensitivity of 59\% and specificity of 38\% with respect to the two-domain proteins. DOMpro also achieved a sensitivity and specificity of 71\% and 71\% respectively in the Critical Assessment of Fully Automated Structure Prediction 4 (CAFASP-4) (Fisher et al., 1999; Saini and Fischer, 2005) and was ranked among the top ab initio domain predictors.

abstract = {The biochemical and physical factors controlling protein expression level and solubility in vivo remain incompletely characterized. To gain insight into the primary sequence features influencing these outcomes, we performed statistical analyses of results from the high-throughput protein-production pipeline of the Northeast Structural Genomics Consortium. Proteins expressed in E. coli and consistently purified were scored independently for expression and solubility levels. These parameters nonetheless show a very strong positive correlation. We used logistic regressions to determine whether they are systematically influenced by fractional amino acid composition or several bulk sequence parameters including hydrophobicity, sidechain entropy, electrostatic charge, and predicted backbone disorder. Decreasing hydrophobicity correlates with higher expression and solubility levels, but this correlation apparently derives solely from the beneficial effect of three charged amino acids, at least for bacterial proteins. In fact, the three most hydrophobic residues showed very different correlations with solubility level. Leu showed the strongest negative correlation among amino acids, while Ile showed a slightly positive correlation in most data segments. Several other amino acids also had unexpected effects. Notably, Arg correlated with decreased expression and, most surprisingly, solubility of bacterial proteins, an effect only partially attributable to rare codons. However, rare codons did significantly reduce expression despite use of a codon-enhanced strain. Additional analyses suggest that positively but not negatively charged amino acids may reduce translation efficiency in E. coli irrespective of codon usage. While some observed effects may reflect indirect evolutionary correlations, others may reflect basic physicochemical phenomena. We used these results to construct and validate predictors of expression and solubility levels and overall protein usability, and we propose new strategies to be explored for engineering improved protein expression and solubility.},

However, structural and functional characterizations of weak PPIs have been technically challenging and lagged behind those for strong PPIs. Here, we describe nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy as a highly effective tool for unraveling the atomic details of weak PPIs. We highlight the recent advances of how NMR can be used to rapidly detect and structurally determine extremely weak PPIs (Kd>10-4 M). Coupled with functional approaches, NMR has the potential to look into a wide variety of biologically important weak PPIs at the detailed molecular level, thereby facilitating a thorough view of how proteins function in living cells. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Allosteric regulation is an effective mechanism of control in biological processes. In allosteric proteins a signal originating at one site in the molecule is communicated through the protein structure to trigger a specific response at a remote site. Using NMR relaxation dispersion techniques we directly observe the dynamic process through which the KIX domain of CREB binding protein communicates allosteric information between binding sites. KIX mediates cooperativity between pairs of transcription factors through binding to two distinct interaction surfaces in an allosteric manner. We show that binding the activation domain of the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) transcription factor to KIX induces a redistribution of the relative populations of KIX conformations toward a high-energy state in which the allosterically activated second binding site is already preformed, consistent with the Monod-Wyman-Changeux (WMC) model of allostery. The structural rearrangement process that links the two conformers and by which allosteric information is communicated occurs with a time constant of 3 ms at 27 degrees C. Our dynamic NMR data reveal that an evolutionarily conserved network of hydrophobic amino acids constitutes the pathway through which information is transmitted.},

With continuing advances in metabolomics along with constant user feedback, it became clear that a substantial upgrade to the original server was necessary. MetaboAnalyst 2.0, which is the successor to MetaboAnalyst, represents just such an upgrade. MetaboAnalyst 2.0 now contains dozens of new features and functions including new procedures for data filtering, data editing and data normalization. It also supports multi-group data analysis, two-factor analysis as well as time-series data analysis. These new functions have also been supplemented with: (i) a quality-control module that allows users to evaluate their data quality before conducting any analysis, (ii) a functional enrichment analysis module that allows users to identify biologically meaningful patterns using metabolite set enrichment analysis and (iii) a metabolic pathway analysis module that allows users to perform pathway analysis and visualization for 15 different model organisms. In developing MetaboAnalyst 2.0 we have also substantially improved its graphical presentation tools. All images are now generated using anti-aliasing and are available over a range of resolutions, sizes and formats (PNG, TIFF, PDF, PostScript, or SVG). To improve its performance, MetaboAnalyst 2.0 is now hosted on a much more powerful server with substantially modified code to take advantage the server's multi-core CPUs for computationally intensive tasks. MetaboAnalyst 2.0 also maintains a collection of 50 or more FAQs and more than a dozen tutorials compiled from user queries and requests.

abstract = {Many of today's drug discovery programs use high-throughput screening methods that rely on quick evaluations of protein activity to rank potential chemical leads. By monitoring biologically relevant protein-ligand interactions, NMR can provide a means to validate these discovery leads and to optimize the drug discovery process. NMR-based screens typically use a change in chemical shift or line width to detect a protein-ligand interaction. However, the relatively low throughput of current NMR screens and their high demand on sample requirements generally makes it impractical to collect complete binding curves to measure the affinity for each compound in a large and diverse chemical library. As a result, NMR ligand screens are typically limited to identifying candidates that bind to a protein and do not give any estimate of the binding affinity. To address this issue, a methodology has been developed to rank binding affinities for ligands based on NMR screens that use 1D (1)H NMR line-broadening experiments. This method was demonstrated by using it to estimate the dissociation equilibrium constants for twelve ligands with the protein human serum albumin (HSA). The results were found to give good agreement with previous affinities that have been reported for these same ligands with HSA.},

abstract = {Accurate quantitation of the spectral components in a pre-selected frequency band for magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) signals is a frequently addressed problem in the MR community. One obvious application for such a frequency-selective technique is to lower the computational burden in situations when the measured data sequence contains too many samples to be processed using a standard full-spectrum method. Among the frequency-selective methods previously proposed in the literature, only a few possess the two features of primary concern: high robustness against interferences from out-of-band components and low computational complexity. In this survey paper we consider five spectral analysis methods which can be used for MRS signal parameter estimation in a selected frequency band. We re-derive the filter diagonalization method (FDM) in a new way that allows an easy comparison to the other methods presented. Then we introduce a frequency-selective version of the method of direction estimation (MODE) which has not been applied to MR-spectroscopy before. In addition, we present a filtering and decimation technique using a maximum phase bandpass FIR-filter and relate it to a similar ARMA-modeling approach known as SB-HOYWSVD (sub-band high-order Yule-Walker singular value decomposition). Finally, we study the numerical performances of these four methods and compare them to that of the recently introduced SELF-SVD (Singular Value Decomposition-based method usable in a SELected Frequency band) in several examples using simulated MR data, and discuss the benefits and disadvantages of each technique. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

The scheme of quantification from 2D HSQC spectra consists of measurement of relaxation parameters of proton resonances, such as T(1) and T(2) of the metabolites and (1)H-(13)C heteronuclear J-coupling for accurate quantification. The measured cross-peak volume from 2D HSQC NMR spectra is multiplied by a calculated correction factor (which depends upon two-dimensional NMR experimental parameters and relaxation parameters) to measure accurate quantification of the metabolite. The correction factor is theoretically derived from the solution of the Bloch equation and product operator formalism. The accuracy of the scheme is tested on a solution containing a mixture of amino acids of known concentration. For human urine samples, the accuracy of the method for measuring the concentration of various metabolites was tested with spike-in experiments. The scheme is general in nature and can be applied to any other body fluid samples for metabonomic studies. We also test the measured cross-peak volume of various metabolites from 2D (1)H-(13)C HSQC NMR spectra of human urine samples for clustering analysis with scatter plots, making the scheme complete for metabolic profiling.},

abstract = {We describe and demonstrate an inexpensive, easy-to-build, portable spectrometer for nuclear magnetic resonance measurements in the Earth's magnetic field. The spectrometer is based upon a widely available inexpensive microcontroller, which acts as a pulse programmer, audio-frequency synthesizer and digitizer, replacing what are typically the most expensive specialized components of the system. The microcontroller provides the capability to execute arbitrarily long and complicated sequences of phase-coherent, phase-modulated excitation pulses and acquire data sets of unlimited duration. Suitably packaged, the spectrometer is amenable to measurements in the research lab, in the field or in the teaching lab. The choice of components was heavily weighted by cost and availability, but required no significant sacrifice in performance. Using an existing personal computer, the resulting design can be assembled for as little as US\$200. The spectrometer performance is demonstrated with spin-echo and Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill pulse sequences on a water sample.},

abstract = {A combined electronic structure/molecular dynamics approach was used to calculate infrared and isotropic Raman spectra for the OH or OD stretches of dilute HOD in D2O or H2O, respectively. The quantities needed to compute the infrared and Raman spectra were obtained from density functional theory calculations performed on clusters, generated from liquid-state configurations, containing an HOD molecule along with 4-9 solvent water molecules. The frequency, transition dipole, and isotropic transition polarizability were each empirically related to the electric field due to the solvent along the OH (or OD) bond, calculated on the H (or D) atom of interest. The frequency and transition dipole moment of the OH (or OD) stretch of the HOD molecule were found to be very sensitive to its instantaneous solvent environment, as opposed to the isotropic transition polarizability, which was found to be relatively insensitive to environment. Infrared and isotropic Raman spectra were computed within a molecular dynamics simulation by using the empirical relationships and semiclassical expressions for the line shapes. The line shapes agree well with experiment over a temperature range from 10 to 90 degrees C.},

abstract = {One-dimensional 1H nuclear magnetic reso- nance (1D 1H-NMR) has been used extensively as a metabolic profiling tool for investigating urine and other biological fluids. Under ideal conditions, 1H-NMR peak intensities are directly proportional to metabolite concen- trations and thus are useful for class prediction and biomarker discovery. However, many biological, experi- mental and instrumental variables can affect absolute NMR peak intensities. Normalizing or scaling data to minimize the influence of these variables is a critical step in pro- ducing robust, reproducible analyses. Traditionally, analyses of biological fluids have relied on the total spec- tral area [constant sum (CS)] to normalize individual intensities. This approach can introduce considerable inter- sample variance as changes in any individual metabolite will affect the scaling of all of the observed intensities. To reduce normalization-related variance, we have developed a histogram matching (HM) approach adapted from the field of image processing. We validate our approach using mixtures of synthetic compounds that mimic a biological extract and apply the method to an analysis of urine from rats treated with ethionine. We show that HM is a robust method for normalizing 1H-NMR data and propose it as an alternative to the traditional CS method.},

A generally useful method for obtaining electronic and vibrational Stark spectra that does not require sophisticated equipment is described. By working with frozen glasses it is possible to study nearly any molecular system, including ions and proteins. Quantitative analysis of the spectra provides information on the change in dipole moment and polarizability associated with a transition. The change in dipole moment reflects the degree of charge separation for a transition, a quantity of interest to a variety of fields. The polarizability change describes the sensitivity of a transition to an electrostatic field such as that found in a protein or an ordered synthetic material. Applications to donor-acceptor polyenes, transition metal complexes (metal-to-ligand and metal-to-metal mixed valence transitions), and nonphotosynthetic biological systems are reviewed.},

In addition, it can be used to study protein interactions.

MALDI-ToF contour plot analysis confirmed the randomness of the copolymers. The controlled character of the low temperature NCA polymerization was further verified by the successful block copolymer synthesis from polypeptide macroinitiators, which confirms the availability of the amino end-groups for chain extension. Moreover, graft copolymers were obtained by grafting of benzyl-L-glutamate NCA from lysine-containing copolymers. The formation of gels from the graft and corresponding block copolymers was investigated. While for the block copolymers interconnected polymer particles were observed by optical microscopy, the graft copolymers form an open cell structure.},

abstract = {In metabolomics, tissues typically are extracted by grinding in liquid nitrogen followed by the stepwise addition of solvents. This is time-consuming and difficult to automate, and the multiple steps can introduce variability. Here we optimize tissue extraction methods compatible with high-throughput, reproducible nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy- and mass spectrometry (MS)-based metabolomics. Previously, we concluded that methanol/chloroform/water extraction is preferable for metabolomics, and we further optimized this here using fish liver and an automated Precellys 24 bead-based homogenizer, allowing rapid extraction of multiple samples without carryover. We compared three solvent addition strategies: stepwise, two-step, and all solvents simultaneously. Then we evaluated strategies for improved partitioning of metabolites between solvent phases, including the addition of extra water and different partition times. Polar extracts were analyzed by NMR and principal components analysis, and the two-step approach was preferable based on lipid partitioning, reproducibility, yield, and throughput. Longer partitioning or extra water increased yield and decreased lipids in the polar phase but caused metabolic decay in these extracts. Overall, we conclude that the two-step method with extra water provides good quality data but that the two-step method with 10 min partitioning provides a more accurate snapshot of the metabolome. Finally, when validating the two-step strategy using NMR and MS metabolomics, we showed that technical variability was considerably smaller than biological variability. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {This article discusses problems of validating classification models especially in datasets where sample sizes are small and the number of variables is large. It describes the use of percentage correctly classified (\%CC) as an indicator for success of a classification model. For small datasets, \%CC should not be used uncritically and its interpretation depends on sample size. It illustrates the use of a common classification method, discriminant partial least squares (D-PLS) on a randomly generated dataset of 200 samples and 200 variables. An aim of the classifier is to determine whether the null hypothesis (there is no distinction between two classes) can be rejected. Autoprediction gives an 84.5\% CC. It is shown that, if there is variable selection, it must be performed independently on the training set to obtain a CC close to 50\% on the test set; otherwise, over-optimistic and false conclusions can be reached about the ability to classify samples into groups. Finally, two aims of determining the quality of a model are frequently confused, namely optimisation (often used to determine the most appropriate number of components in a model) and independent validation; to overcome this, the data should be split into three groups. There are often difficulties with model building if validation and optimisation have been done on different groups of samples, especially using iterative methods, each group being modelled using properties, such as a different number of components or different variables. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Abstract The O2-PLS method is derived from the basic partial least squares projections to latent structures (PLS) prediction approach. The importance of the covariation matrix (YTX) is pointed out in relation to both the prediction model and the structured noise in both X and Y. Structured noise in X (or Y) is defined as the systematic variation of X (or Y) not linearly correlated with Y (or X). Examples in spectroscopy include baseline, drift and scatter effects. If structured noise is present in X, the existing latent variable regression (LVR) methods, e.g. PLS, will have weakened score–loading correspondence beyond the first component. This negatively affects the interpretation of model parameters such as scores and loadings. The O2-PLS method models and predicts both X and Y and has an integral orthogonal signal correction (OSC) filter that separates the structured noise in X and Y from their joint X–Y covariation used in the prediction model. This leads to a minimal number of predictive components with full score–loading correspondence and also an opportunity to interpret the structured noise. In both a real and a simulated example, O2-PLS and PLS gave very similar predictions of Y. However, the interpretation of the prediction models was clearly improved with O2-PLS, because structured noise was present. In the NIR example, O2-PLS revealed a strong water peak and baseline offset in the structured noise components. In the simulated example the O2-PLS plot of observed versus predicted Y-scores (u vs uhat) showed good predictions. The corresponding loading vectors provided good interpretation of the covarying analytes in X and Y. Copyright © 2003 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

In the first part of this article, we focus on a few reasons as to why the solution to the protein-folding problem (PFP) has been elusive for a very long time. One is a result of the misinterpretation of Anfinsen's Thermodynamic hypothesis which led to the conclusion that the native structure of a protein must be at a global minimum of the Gibbs energy. The second is the result of the adherence to the hydrophobic paradigm, and at the same time ignoring a whole repertoire of hydrophilic effects. It is argued that switching from a target-based to a caused-based approach, and adopting the hydrophilic paradigm leads straightforwardly to a simple answer to Levinthal's question, as well as to a solution of the PFP.},

abstract = {Humans have evolved intimate symbiotic relationships with a consortium of gut microbes (microbiome) and individual variations in the microbiome influence host health, may be implicated in disease etiology, and affect drug metabolism, toxicity, and efficacy. However, the molecular basis of these microbe-host interactions and the roles of individual bacterial species are obscure. We now demonstrate a"transgenomic" approach to link gut microbiome and metabolic phenotype (metabotype) variation. We have used a combination of spectroscopic, microbiomic, and multivariate statistical tools to analyze fecal and urinary samples from seven Chinese individuals (sampled twice) and to model the microbial-host metabolic connectivities. At the species level, we found structural differences in the Chinese family gut microbiomes and those reported for American volunteers, which is consistent with population microbial cometabolic differences reported in epidemiological studies. We also introduce the concept of functional metagenomics, defined as "the characterization of key functional members of the microbiome that most influence host metabolism and hence health." For example, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii population variation is associated with modulation of eight urinary metabolites of diverse structure, indicating that this species is a highly functionally active member of the microbiome, influencing numerous host pathways. Other species were identified showing different and varied metabolic interactions. Our approach for understanding the dynamic basis of host-microbiome symbiosis provides a foundation for the development of functional metagenomics as a probe of systemic effects of drugs and diet that are of relevance to personal and public health care solutions.},

abstract = {A new software tool has been developed that provides automated measurement of signal intensities in NMR spectra of complex mixtures without using data reduction procedures. The algorithm finds best-fit transformations between signals in reference compound spectra and the corresponding signals in analyte spectra. Unlike other algorithms, it is insensitive to variation in chemical shift and can even be used for relative quantitation of compounds whose identities have not yet been established. Additionally, the parameters of the transformation provide information and error metrics that may assist in the streamlining of quality control. The approach presented is general in scope but has been tested by application to peak quantitation in NMR spectra of biofluids. Replicate NMR measurements of solutions of biologically important compounds at various concentrations were made. Further NMR data were collected on urine samples from human, rat, and mouse, which were "spiked" with reference compound solutions at known concentrations. Finally, existing data from an independent toxicology project involving several hundred samples were analyzed, and the consistency of the measurements for metabolites that give multiple NMR signals was assessed. The results of all these tests give confidence that the technique can be used in automated quantitation of compounds in large NMR data sets with minimal operator intervention.},

abstract = {This paper proposes an uncorrelated multilinear principal component analysis (UMPCA) algorithm for unsupervised subspace learning of tensorial data. It should be viewed as a multilinear extension of the classical principal component analysis (PCA) framework. Through successive variance maximization, UMPCA seeks a tensor-to-vector projection (TVP) that captures most of the variation in the original tensorial input while producing uncorrelated features. The solution consists of sequential iterative steps based on the alternating projection method. In addition to deriving the UMPCA framework, this work offers a way to systematically determine the maximum number of uncorrelated multilinear features that can be extracted by the method. UMPCA is compared against the baseline PCA solution and its five state-of-the-art multilinear extensions, namely two-dimensional PCA (2DPCA), concurrent subspaces analysis (CSA), tensor rank-one decomposition (TROD), generalized PCA (GPCA), and multilinear PCA (MPCA), on the tasks of unsupervised face and gait recognition. Experimental results included in this paper suggest that UMPCA is particularly effective in determining the low-dimensional projection space needed in such recognition tasks.},

On the basis of this shape, individual mass spectral peak abundance profiles are extracted to produce a 'purified' spectrum. In the present work, ion-counting noise is explicitly treated and a number of characteristic features of GC/MS data are taken into account. This allows spectrum extraction to be reliably performed down to very low signal levels and for overlapping components. A spectrum match factor for compound identification is developed that incorporates a number of new corrections, some of which employ information derived from chromatographic behavior.

abstract = {Time-resolved experiments demand high resolution both in spectral dimensions and in time of the studied kinetic process. The latter requirement traditionally prohibits applications of the multidimensional experiments, which, although capable of providing invaluable information about structure and dynamics and almost unlimited spectral resolution, require too lengthy data collection. Our work shows that the problem has a solution in using modern methods of NMR data collection and signal processing. A continuous fast pulsing three-dimensional experiment is acquired using non-uniform sampling during full time of the studied reaction. High sensitivity and time-resolution of a few minutes is achieved by simultaneous processing of the full data set with the multi-dimensional decomposition. The method is verified and illustrated in realistic simulations and by measuring deuterium exchange rates of amide protons in ubiquitin. We applied the method for characterizing kinetics of in vitro phosphorylation of two tyrosine residues in an intrinsically disordered cytosolic domain of the B cell receptor protein CD79b. Signals of many residues including tyrosines in both phosphorylated and unmodified forms of CD79b are found in a heavily crowded region of 2D ¹H-¹⁵N correlation spectrum and the significantly enhanced spectral resolution provided by the 3D time-resolved approach was essential for the quantitative site-specific analysis.},

abstract = {A frequent problem in analysis is the need to find two matrices, closely related to the underlying measurement process, which when multiplied together reproduce the matrix of data points. Such problems arise throughout science, for example, in imaging where both the calibration of the sensor and the true scene may be unknown and in localized spectroscopy where multiple components may be present in varying amounts in any spectrum. Since both matrices are unknown, such a decomposition is a bilinear problem. We report here a solution to this problem for the case in which the decomposition results in matrices with elements drawn from positive additive distributions. We demonstrate the power of the methodology on chemical shift images (CSI). The new method, Bayesian spectral decomposition (BSD), reduces the CSI data to a small number of basis spectra together with their localized amplitudes. We apply this new algorithm to a 19F nonlocalized study of the catabolism of 5-fluorouracil in human liver, 31P CSI studies of a human head and calf muscle, and simulations which show its strengths and limitations. In all cases, the dataset, viewed as a matrix with rows containing the individual NMR spectra, results from the multiplication of a matrix of generally nonorthogonal basis spectra (the spectral matrix) by a matrix of the amplitudes of each basis spectrum in the the individual voxels (the amplitude matrix). The results show that BSD can simultaneously determine both the basis spectra and their distribution. In principle, BSD should solve this bilinear problem for any dataset which results  from multiplication of matrices representing positive additive distributions if the data overdetermine the solutions.},

This study was therefore designed to analyze the proteome of such specimens and identify new candidate proteins for differential diagnosis. Methods: A PowerBlot analysis with more than 900 well-characterized antibodies was performed with tissue specimens from patients with chronic pancreatitis, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and normal pancreas. Differential expression of selected proteins was confirmed on a larger scale by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry using tissue arrays. Results: A total of 30 and 102 proteins showed significant deregulation between normal pancreas when compared with chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic adenocarcinoma, respectively, and although a substantial proportion were found similarly dysregulated in both chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic adenocarcinoma, several proteins were identified as potential disease-specific markers. Conclusions: A large number of proteins are differentially expressed in chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic adenocarcinoma compared with normal pancreas. Among these, expression analysis of UHRF1, ATP7A, and aldehyde oxidase 1 in combination could potentially provide a useful additional diagnostic tool for fine-needle aspirated or cytological specimens obtained during endoscopic investigations. ?? 2005 by the American Gastroenterological Association.},

abstract = {Hydrophobic hydration is considered to have a key role in biological processes ranging from membrane formation to protein folding and ligand binding. Historically, hydrophobic hydration shells were thought to resemble solid clathrate hydrates, with solutes surrounded by polyhedral cages composed of tetrahedrally hydrogen-bonded water molecules. But more recent experimental and theoretical studies have challenged this view and emphasized the importance of the length scales involved. Here we report combined polarized, isotopic and temperature-dependent Raman scattering measurements with multivariate curve resolution (Raman-MCR) that explore hydrophobic hydration by mapping the vibrational spectroscopic features arising from the hydrophobic hydration shells of linear alcohols ranging from methanol to heptanol. Our data, covering the entire 0-100 °C temperature range, show clear evidence that at low temperatures the hydration shells have a hydrophobically enhanced water structure with greater tetrahedral order and fewer weak hydrogen bonds than the surrounding bulk water. This structure disappears with increasing temperature and is then, for hydrophobic chains longer than \~{}1 nm, replaced by a more disordered structure with weaker hydrogen bonds than bulk water. These observations support our current understanding of hydrophobic hydration, including the thermally induced water structural transformation that is suggestive of the hydrophobic crossover predicted to occur at lengths of \~{}1 nm (refs 5, 9, 10, 14).},

abstract = {Correct identification of the origins of herbal medical products is becoming increasingly important in tandem with the growing interest in alternative medicine. However, visual inspection of raw material is still the most widely used method, and newer scientific approaches are needed. To develop a more objective and efficient tool for discriminating herbal origins, particularly Korean and Chinese, we employed a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolomics approach combined with an orthogonal projections to latent structure-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) multivariate analysis. We first analyzed the constituent metabolites of Scutellaria baicalensis through NMR studies. Subsequent holistic data analysis with OPLS-DA yielded a statistical model that could cleanly discriminate between the sample groups even in the presence of large structured noise. An analysis of the statistical total correlation spectroscopy (STOCSY) spectrum identified citric acid and arginine as the key discriminating metabolites for Korean and Chinese samples. As a validation of the discrimination model, we performed blind prediction tests of sample origins using an external test set. Our model correctly predicted the origins of all of the 11 test samples, demonstrating its robustness. We tested the wider applicability of the developed method with three additional herbal medicines from Korea and China and obtained very high prediction accuracy. The solid discriminatory power and statistical validity of our method suggest its general applicability for determining the origins of herbal medicines.},

abstract = {NMR chemical shifts in proteins depend strongly on local structure. The program TALOS establishes an empirical relation between 13C, 15N and 1H chemical shifts and backbone torsion angles phi and psi (Cornilescu et al. J Biomol NMR 13 289-302, 1999). Extension of the original 20-protein database to 200 proteins increased the fraction of residues for which backbone angles could be predicted from 65 to 74\%, while reducing the error rate from 3 to 2.5\%. Addition of a two-layer neural network filter to the database fragment selection process forms the basis for a new program, TALOS+, which further enhances the prediction rate to 88.5\%, without increasing the error rate. Excluding the 2.5\% of residues for which TALOS+ makes predictions that strongly differ from those observed in the crystalline state, the accuracy of predicted phi and psi angles, equals +/-13 degrees . Large discrepancies between predictions and crystal structures are primarily limited to loop regions, and for the few cases where multiple X-ray structures are available such residues are often found in different states in the different structures. The TALOS+ output includes predictions for individual residues with missing chemical shifts, and the neural network component of the program also predicts secondary structure with good accuracy.},

It is shown that a radiofrequency field at right angles to the constant field causes a forced precession of the total polarization around the constant field with decreasing latitude as the Larmor frequency approaches adiabatically the frequency of the r-f field. Thus there results a component of the nuclear polarization at right angles to both the constant and the r-f field and it is shown that under normal laboratory conditions this component can induce observable voltages. In Section 3 we discuss this nuclear induction, considering the effect of external fields only, while in Section 4 those modifications are described which originate from internal fields and finite relaxation times.},

abstract = {The fast Fourier transformation has been the gold standard for transforming data from time to frequency domain in many spectroscopic methods, including NMR. While reliable, it has as a drawback that it requires a grid of uniformly sampled data points. This needs very long measuring times for sampling in multidimensional experiments in all indirect dimensions uniformly and even does not allow reaching optimal evolution times that would match the resolution power of modern high-field instruments. Thus, many alternative sampling and transformation schemes have been proposed. Their common challenges are the suppression of the artifacts due to the non-uniformity of the sampling schedules, the preservation of the relative signal amplitudes, and the computing time needed for spectra reconstruction. Here we present a fast implementation of the Iterative Soft Thresholding approach (istHMS) that can reconstruct high-resolution non-uniformly sampled NMR data up to four dimensions within a few hours and make routine reconstruction of high-resolution NUS 3D and 4D spectra convenient. We include a graphical user interface for generating sampling schedules with the Poisson-Gap method and an estimation of optimal evolution times based on molecular properties. The performance of the approach is demonstrated with the reconstruction of non-uniformly sampled medium and high-resolution 3D and 4D protein spectra acquired with sampling densities as low as 0.8\%. The method presented here facilitates acquisition, reconstruction and use of multidimensional NMR spectra at otherwise unreachable spectral resolution in indirect dimensions.},

An inexpensive electrochemical workstation could thus prove useful in educational labs, and increase access to electrochemistry-based analytical techniques for food, drug and environmental monitoring. With these motivations in mind, we describe here the CheapStat, an inexpensive (<\$80), open-source (software and hardware), hand-held potentiostat that can be constructed by anyone who is proficient at assembling circuits. This device supports a number of potential waveforms necessary to perform cyclic, square wave, linear sweep and anodic stripping voltammetry.

The availability of high field instruments, the complexity of spectra of large proteins, the narrow signal dispersion of some unstructured proteins, and the time needed to record the necessary increments in the indirect dimensions to exploit the resolution of the highfield instruments make this traditional approach unsatisfactory. New procedures need to be developed beyond uniform sampling of the indirect dimensions and reconstruction methods other than the straight FFT are necessary. Here we discuss approaches of non-uniform sampling (NUS) and suitable reconstruction methods.

A home-built NMR spectrometer can serve complementary roles to a sophisticated commercial spectrometer, should one comes across such new ideas that require heavy modification to hardware inside the spectrometer. This work can lower the barrier of building a handmade NMR spectrometer in the laboratory, and promote novel and exciting NMR experiments. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {NMR-based metabolomics requires robust automated methodologies, and the accuracy of NMR-based metabolomics data is greatly influenced by the reproducibility of data acquisition and processing methods. Effective water resonance signal suppression and reproducible spectral phasing and baseline traces across series of related samples are crucial for statistical analysis. We assess robustness, repeatability, sensitivity, selectivity, and practicality of commonly used solvent peak suppression methods in the NMR analysis of biofluids with respect to the automated processing of the NMR spectra and the impact of pulse sequence and data processing methods on the sensitivity of pattern recognition and statistical analysis of the metabolite profiles. We introduce two modifications to the excitation sculpting pulse sequence whereby the excitation solvent suppression pulse cascade is preceded by low-power water resonance presaturation pulses during the relaxation delay. Our analysis indicates that combining water presaturation with excitation sculpting water suppression delivers the most reproducible and information-rich NMR spectra of biofluids.},

Here, we present an improved method, the Gradient Phase Encoded Spin-lock (GraPES) experiment that integrates the relaxation filter into the diffusion period. Compared with sequential CPMG-BPPSTE pulse sequences, GraPES offers effective suppression of the protein background with improved signal-to-noise ratios and shorter experiment times. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {In the present paper, the concept of orthogonal signal correction (OSC) as a spectral preprocessing method is discussed and a number of OSC algorithms that have appeared are compared from a theoretical viewpoint. Since all of these algorithms had some problems concerning the orthogonality towards Y, non-optimal amount of variance removed from X, or a non-attainable solution, a new direct OSC algorithm (DOSC) is introduced. DOSC was originally developed as a direct method solely based on least squares steps that had none of the problems mentioned above. The first practical results with the new method, however, were not encouraging due to the complete orthogonality constraint. If this orthogonality constraint is loosened, the method improves considerably and simplifies the calibration model for the prediction of Y. Copyright ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {The mechanism that concentrates the urine to an osmolality several times that of systemic plasma results in high concentrations of solutes (particularly NaCl and urea) in extracellular fluid of renal medulla, but not in the labyrinth of the renal cortex. Intracellular and extracellular osmolality must be equal in animals, but the known intracellular levels of Na and K salts and urea in renal medullas are much too low to balance the high extracellular osmolality. The purpose of these studies was to identify the other intracellular osmolytes that must be present. Cortexes and medullas from rabbit and rat kidneys were analyzed by proton nuclear magnetic resonance, mass spectrometry, and chemical assays to determine the identity and amount of organic solutes. Large amounts of glycerophosphorylcholine, betaine, sorbitol, and inositol were found in both species localized almost exclusively to the inner medulla. In rabbits during antidiuresis glycerophosphorylcholine, betaine, and sorbitol were present in the inner medulla, at concentrations of 21.1, 34.8, and 20.8 mumol/g wet weight, respectively, but were not detected in the cortex. Inositol was present in rabbit inner medulla at 10.7 mumol/g wet weight and was also present in the cortex, but at lower concentration. None of the above metabolites was present in measurable amounts in urine or peripheral plasma. The accumulation in the cells of the inner medulla of relatively large amounts of betaine, sorbitol, glycerophosphorylcholine and inositol during antidiuresis suggests that they may play a significant role in the maintenance of intracellular osmotic balance.},

abstract = {The increasing scientific and industrial interest towards metabonomics takes advantage from the high qualitative and quantitative information level of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. However, several chemical and physical factors can affect the absolute and the relative position of an NMR signal and it is not always possible or desirable to eliminate these effects a priori. To remove misalignment of NMR signals a posteriori, several algorithms have been proposed in the literature. The icoshift program presented here is an open source and highly efficient program designed for solving signal alignment problems in metabonomic NMR data analysis. The icoshift algorithm is based on correlation shifting of spectral intervals and employs an FFT engine that aligns all spectra simultaneously. The algorithm is demonstrated to be faster than similar methods found in the literature making full-resolution alignment of large datasets feasible and thus avoiding down-sampling steps such as binning. The algorithm uses missing values as a filling alternative in order to avoid spectral artifacts at the segment boundaries. The algorithm is made open source and the Matlab code including documentation can be downloaded from www.models.life.ku.dk. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {What are the atomic motions at enzymatic catalytic sites on the timescale of chemical change? Combined experimental and computational chemistry approaches take advantage of transition-state analogs to reveal dynamic motions linked to transition-state formation. QM/MM transition path sampling from reactive complexes provides both temporal and dynamic information for barrier crossing. Fast (femtosecond to picosecond) dynamic motions provide essential links to enzymatic barrier crossing by local or promoting-mode dynamic searches through bond-vibrational space. Transition-state lifetimes are within the femtosecond timescales of bond vibrations and show no manifestations of stabilized, equilibrated complexes. The slow binding and protein conformational changes (microsecond to millisecond) also required for catalysis are temporally decoupled from the fast dynamic motions forming the transition state. According to this view of enzymatic catalysis, transition states are formed by fast, coincident dynamic excursions of catalytic site elements, while the binding of transition-state analogs is the conversion of the dynamic excursions to equilibrated states.},

abstract = {Human heart short chain L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (SCHAD) catalyzes the oxidation of the hydroxyl group of L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA to a keto group, concomitant with the reduction of NAD+ to NADH, as part of the beta-oxidation pathway. The homodimeric enzyme has been overexpressed in Escherichia coli, purified to homogeneity, and studied using biochemical and crystallographic techniques. The dissociation constants of NAD+ and NADH have been determined over a broad pH range and indicate that SCHAD binds reduced cofactor preferentially. Examination of apparent catalytic constants reveals that SCHAD displays optimal enzymatic activity near neutral pH, with catalytic efficiency diminishing rapidly toward pH extremes. The crystal structure of SCHAD complexed with NAD+ has been solved using multiwavelength anomalous diffraction techniques and a selenomethionine-substituted analogue of the enzyme. The subunit structure is comprised of two domains. The first domain is similar to other alpha/beta dinucleotide folds but includes an unusual helix-turn-helix motif which extends from the central beta-sheet. The second, or C-terminal, domain is primarily alpha-helical and mediates subunit dimerization and, presumably, L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA binding. Molecular modeling studies in which L-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA was docked into the enzyme-NAD+ complex suggest that His 158 serves as a general base, abstracting a proton from the 3-OH group of the substrate. Furthermore, the ability of His 158 to perform such a function may be enhanced by an electrostatic interaction with Glu 170, consistent with previous biochemical observations. These studies provide further understanding of the molecular basis of several inherited metabolic disease states correlated with L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiencies.},

abstract = {The Fourier transform has been the gold standard for transforming data from the time domain to the frequency domain in many spectroscopic methods, including NMR spectroscopy. While reliable, it has the drawback that it requires a grid of uniformely sampled data points, which is not efficient for decaying signals, and it also suffers from artifacts when dealing with nondecaying signals. Over several decades, many alternative sampling and transformation schemes have been proposed. Their common problem is that relative signal amplitudes are not well-preserved. Here we demonstrate the superior performance of a sine-weighted Poisson-gap distribution sparse-sampling scheme combined with forward maximum entropy (FM) reconstruction. While the relative signal amplitudes are well-preserved, we also find that the signal-to-noise ratio is enhanced up to 4-fold per unit of data acquisition time relative to traditional linear sampling.},

abstract = {The use of chemometric data processing is becoming an important part of modern chromatography. Most chemometric analyses are performed on reduced data sets using areas of selected peaks detected in the chromatograms, which means a loss of data and introduces the problem of extracting peak data from the chromatographic profiles. These disavantages can be overcome by using the entire chromatographic data matrix in chemometric analyses, but it is necessary to align the chromatograms, as small unavoidable differences in experimental conditions causes minor changes and drift. Previous aligning methods either fail to utilise the entire data matrix or rely on peak detection, thus having the same limitations as the commonly used chemometric procedures. The method presented uses the entire chromatographic data matrices and does not require any preprocessing e.g., peak detection. It relies on piecewise linear correlation optimised warping (COW) using two input parameters which can be estimated from the observed peak width. COW is demonstrated on constructed single trace chromatograms and on single and multiple wavelength chromatograms obtained from HPLC diode detection analyses of fungal extracts.},

abstract = {The KIX domain of the transcriptional coactivator CREB binding protein (CBP) co-operatively mediates interactions between transcription factors. Binding of the transcription factor mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) induces the formation of a low-populated conformer of KIX that resembles the conformation of the KIX domain in the presence of a second transcription factor molecule. NMR spin relaxation studies have previously shown that allosteric coupling proceeds through a network of hydrophobic core residues that bridge the two binding sites. Here we describe high-resolution NMR solution structures of the binary complex of KIX with MLL and the ternary complex of KIX formed with MLL and phosphorylated kinase inducible domain of CREB (pKID) as a second ligand. We show that binding of pKID to the binary complex of KIX with MLL is accompanied by a defined repacking of the allosteric network in the hydrophobic core of the protein. Rotamer populations derived from methyl group (13)C chemical shifts reveal a dynamic contribution to the repacking process that is not captured by the structural coordinates and exemplify the dynamic nature of allosteric communication in the KIX domain.},

abstract = {We demonstrate the feasibility of computing realistic spatial proton distributions for proteins in solution from experimental NMR nuclear Overhauser effect data only and with minimal assignments. The method, CLOUDS, relies on precise and abundant interproton distance restraints calculated via a relaxation matrix analysis of sets of experimental nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy crosspeaks. The MIDGE protocol was adapted for this purpose. A gas of unassigned, unconnected H atoms is condensed into a structured proton distribution (cloud) via a molecular dynamics simulated-annealing scheme in which the internuclear distances and van der Waals repulsive terms are the only active restraints. Proton densities are generated by combining a large number of such clouds, each computed from a different trajectory. After filtering by reference to the cloud closest to the mean, a minimal dispersion proton density (foc) is identified. The latter affords a quasi-continuous hydrogen-only probability distribution that conveys immediate information on the protein surface topology (grooves, protrusions, potential binding site cavities, etc.), directly related to the molecular structure. Feasibility of the method was tested on NMR data measured on two globular protein domains of low regular secondary structure content, the col 2 domain of human matrix metalloproteinase-2 and the kringle 2 domain of human plasminogen, of 60 and 83 amino acid residues, respectively.},

abstract = {Several new methods for the controlled ring-opening polymerization of N-carboxyanhydrides (NCA ROP) have been established in the recent past, all of which based on the normal amine mechanism. In this paper the optimal NAM polymerization conditions were investigated combining the high-vacuum and the low-temperature for the NCAs of $\gamma$-benzyl-L-glutamate (BLG), N$\epsilon$-benzyloxycarbonyl-L-lysine (ZLL), L-alanine (Ala), $\beta$-benzyl-L-aspartate (BLA), O-benzyl-L-serine (BLS), and O-benzyl-L-threonine (BLT). The polymerizations were followed by FTIR, size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and MALDI-ToF-MS to provide information of the monomer conversion, polymer molecular weight and chain composition as a function of pressure and temperature. It was found that the studied NCAs could be divided into two groups: in the first group monomers of BLG, ZLL and Ala polymerized considerably faster when a lower pressure of 1 × 10−5 bar was applied. MALDI-ToF-MS analysis confirmed that the formation of side products for these monomers mostly started after full monomer conversion. The second group of monomers, i.e. BLA, BLS and BLT, polymerized considerably slower than the first group and no effect was observed from the lower pressure. On the other hand, the number of side reactions was significant at 20 °C, so that the polymerizations for the latter monomers should preferably be done at 0 °C. By combining both methods, multiblock polypeptides were synthesized including a tetrablock of PBLG-b-PAla-b-PZLL-b-PBLA with a polydispersity of 1.3.},

abstract = {For a long time, NMR chemical shifts have been used to identify protein secondary structures. Currently, this is accomplished through comparing the observed 1H, 13C, 13C, or 13C chemical shifts with the random coil values. Here, we present a new protocol, which is based on the joint probability of each of the three secondary structural types (-strand, -helix, and random coil) derived from chemical-shift data, to identify the secondary structure. In combination with empirical smooth filters/functions, this protocol shows significant improvements in the accuracy and the confidence of identification. Updated chemical-shift statistics are reported, on the basis of which the reliability of using chemical shift to identify protein secondary structure is evaluated for each nucleus. The reliability varies greatly among the 20 amino acids, but, on average, is in the order of: 13C>13C>1H>13C>15N>1HN to distinguish an -helix from a random coil; and 1H>13C >1HN ∼13C∼13C∼15N for a -strand from a random coil. Amide 15N and 1HN chemical shifts, which are generally excluded from the application, in fact, were found to be helpful in distinguishing a -strand from a random coil. In addition, the chemical-shift statistical data are compared with those reported previously, and the results are discussed},

When prior information is incorporated into the analysis of time domain data, the frequencies, decay rate constants, and amplitudes may be estimated much more precisely than by direct use of discrete Fourier transforms. Here, Bayesian probability theory is used to estimate paramters using quadrature models of NMR data.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) is a powerful technique to reveal and compare quantitative metabolic profiles of biological tissues. However, chemical and physical sample variations make the analysis of the data challenging, and typically require the application of a number of preprocessing steps prior to data interpretation. For example, noise reduction, normalization, baseline correction, peak picking, spectrum alignment and statistical analysis are indispensable components in any NMR analysis pipeline.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We introduce a novel suite of informatics tools for the quantitative analysis of NMR metabolomic profile data. The core of the processing cascade is a novel peak alignment algorithm, called hierarchical Cluster-based Peak Alignment (CluPA). The algorithm aligns a target spectrum to the reference spectrum in a top-down fashion by building a hierarchical cluster tree from peak lists of reference and target spectra and then dividing the spectra into smaller segments based on the most distant clusters of the tree. To reduce the computational time to estimate the spectral misalignment, the method makes use of Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) cross-correlation. Since the method returns a high-quality alignment, we can propose a simple methodology to study the variability of the NMR spectra. For each aligned NMR data point the ratio of the between-group and within-group sum of squares (BW-ratio) is calculated to quantify the difference in variability between and within predefined groups of NMR spectra. This differential analysis is related to the calculation of the F-statistic or a one-way ANOVA, but without distributional assumptions. Statistical inference based on the BW-ratio is achieved by bootstrapping the null distribution from the experimental data.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The workflow performance was evaluated using a previously published dataset. Correlation maps, spectral and grey scale plots show clear improvements in comparison to other methods, and the down-to-earth quantitative analysis works well for the CluPA-aligned spectra. The whole workflow is embedded into a modular and statistically sound framework that is implemented as an R package called "speaq" ("spectrum alignment and quantitation"), which is freely available from http://code.google.com/p/speaq/.},

abstract = {One-dimensional (1)H NMR represents one of the most commonly used analytical techniques in metabolomic studies. The increase in the number of samples analyzed as well as the technical improvements involving instrumentation and spectral acquisition demand increasingly accurate and efficient high-throughput data processing workflows. We present FOCUS, an integrated and innovative methodology that provides a complete data analysis workflow for one-dimensional NMR-based metabolomics. This tool will allow users to easily obtain a NMR peak feature matrix ready for chemometric analysis as well as metabolite identification scores for each peak that greatly simplify the biological interpretation of the results. The algorithm development has been focused on solving the critical difficulties that appear at each data processing step and that can dramatically affect the quality of the results. As well as method integration, simplicity has been one of the main objectives in FOCUS development, requiring very little user input to perform accurate peak alignment, peak picking, and metabolite identification. The new spectral alignment algorithm, RUNAS, allows peak alignment with no need of a reference spectrum, and therefore, it reduces the bias introduced by other alignment approaches. Spectral alignment has been tested against previous methodologies obtaining substantial improvements in the case of moderate or highly unaligned spectra. Metabolite identification has also been significantly improved, using the positional and correlation peak patterns in contrast to a reference metabolite panel. Furthermore, the complete workflow has been tested using NMR data sets from 60 human urine samples and 120 aqueous liver extracts, reaching a successful identification of 42 metabolites from the two data sets. The open-source software implementation of this methodology is available at http://www.urr.cat/FOCUS.},

abstract = {Partial least squares (PLS) was not originally designed as a tool for statistical discrimination. In spite of this, applied scientists routinely use PLS for classification and there is substantial empirical evidence to suggest that it performs well in that role. The interesting question is: why can a procedure that is principally designed for overdetermined regression problems locate and emphasize group structure? Using PLS in this manner has heurestic support owing to the relationship between PLS and canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and the relationship, in turn, between CCA and linear discriminant analysis (LDA). This paper replaces the heuristics with a formal statistical explanation. As a consequence, it will become clear that PLS is to be preferred over PCA when discrimination is the goal and dimension reduction is needed.},

@article{DeMeyer2008,
abstract = {As with every -omics technology, metabolomics requires new methodologies for data processing. Due to the large spectral size, a standard approach in NMR-based metabolomics implies the division of spectra into equally sized bins, thereby simplifying subsequent data analysis. Yet, disadvantages are the loss of information and the occurrence of artifacts caused by peak shifts. Here, a new binning algorithm, Adaptive Intelligent Binning (AI-Binning), which largely circumvents these problems, is presented. AI-Binning recursively identifies bin edges in existing bins, requires only minimal user input, and avoids the use of arbitrary parameters or reference spectra. The performance of AI-Binning is demonstrated using serum spectra from 40 hypertensive and 40 matched normotensive subjects from the Asklepios study. Hypertension is a major cardiovascular risk factor characterized by a complex biochemistry and, in most cases, an unknown origin. The binning algorithm resulted in an improved classification of hypertensive status compared with that of standard binning and facilitated the identification of relevant metabolites. Moreover, since the occurrence of noise variables is largely avoided, AI-Binned spectra can be unit-variance scaled. This enables the detection of relevant, low-intensity metabolites. These results demonstrate the power of AI-Binning and suggest the involvement of alpha-1 acid glycoproteins and choline biochemistry in hypertension.},

abstract = {Abstract In many metabolomics studies, NMR spectra are divided into bins of fixed width. This spectral quantification technique, known as uniform binning, is used to reduce the number of variables for pattern recognition techniques and to mitigate effects from variations in peak positions; however, shifts in peaks near the boundaries can cause dramatic quantitative changes in adjacent bins due to non-overlapping boundaries. Here we describe a new Gaussian binning method that incorporates overlapping bins to minimize these effects. A Gaussian kernel weights the signal contribution relative to distance from bin center, and the overlap between bins is controlled by the kernel standard deviation. Sensitivity to peak shift was assessed for a series of test spectra where the offset frequency was incremented in 0.5 Hz steps. For a 4 Hz shift within a bin width of 24 Hz, the error for uniform binning increased by 150\%, while the error for Gaussian binning increased by 50\%. Further, using a urinary metabolomics data set (from a toxicity study) and principal component analysis (PCA), we showed that the information content in the quantified features was equivalent for Gaussian and uniform binning methods. The separation between groups in the PCA scores plot, measured by the J 2 quality metric, is as good or better for Gaussian binning versus uniform binning. The Gaussian method is shown to be robust in regards to peak shift, while still retaining the information needed by classification and multivariate statistical techniques for NMR-metabolomics data.},

abstract = {Natural disasters such as drought, extreme temperatures, and flooding can severely impact crop production. Understanding the metabolic response of crops threatened with these disasters provides insights into biological response mechanisms that can influence survival. In this study, a comparative analysis of GC-MS and (1)H NMR results was conducted for wild-type and tolerant rice varieties stressed by up to 3 days of submergence and allowed 1 day of postsubmergence recovery. Most metabolomics studies are conducted using a single analytical platform. Each platform, however, has inherent advantages and disadvantages that can influence the analytical coverage of the metabolome. In this work, a more thorough analysis of the plant stress response was possible through the use of both (1)H NMR and GC-MS. Several metabolites, such as S-methyl methionine and the dipeptide alanylglycine, were only detected and quantified by (1)H NMR. The high dynamic range of NMR, as compared with that of the GC-TOF-MS used in this study, provided broad coverage of the metabolome in a single experiment. The sensitivity of GC-MS facilitated the quantitation of sugars, organic acids, and amino acids, some of which were not detected by NMR, and provided additional insights into the regulation of the TCA cycle. The combined metabolic information provided by (1)H NMR and GC-MS was essential for understanding the complex biochemical and molecular response of rice plants to submergence.},

abstract = {Intense radiofrequency power in the form of pulses is applied to an ensemble of spins in a liquid placed in a large static magnetic field H0. The frequency of the pulsed r-f power satisfies the condition for nuclear magnetic resonance, and the pulses last for times which are short compared with the time in which the nutating macroscopic magnetic moment of the entire spin ensemble can decay. After removal of the pulses a non-equilibrium configuration of isochromatic macroscopic moments remains in which the moment vectors precess freely. Each moment vector has a magnitude at a given precession frequency which is determined by the distribution of Larmor frequencies imposed upon the ensemble by inhomogeneities in H0. At times determined by pulse sequences applied in the past the constructive interference of these moment vectors gives rise to observable spontaneous nuclear induction signals. The properties and underlying principles of these spin echo signals are discussed with use of the Bloch theory. Relaxation times are measured directly and accurately from the measurement of echo amplitudes. An analysis includes the effect on relaxation measurements of the self-diffusion of liquid molecules which contain resonant nuclei. Preliminary studies are made of several effects associated with spin echoes, including the observed shifts in magnetic resonance frequency of spins due to magnetic shielding of nuclei contained in molecules.},

abstract = {We have developed an algorithm called fast maximum likelihood reconstruction (FMLR) that performs spectral deconvolution of 1D-2D NMR spectra for the purpose of accurate signal quantification. FMLR constructs the simplest time-domain model (e.g., the model with the fewest number of signals and parameters) whose frequency spectrum matches the visible regions of the spectrum obtained from identical Fourier processing of the acquired data. We describe the application of FMLR to quantitative metabolomics and demonstrate the accuracy of the method by analysis of complex, synthetic mixtures of metabolites and liver extracts. The algorithm demonstrates greater accuracy (0.5-5.0\% error) than peak height analysis and peak integral analysis with greatly reduced operator intervention. FMLR has been implemented in a Java-based framework that is available for download on multiple platforms and is interoperable with popular NMR display and processing software. Two-dimensional (1)H-(13)C spectra of mixtures can be acquired with acquisition times of 15 min and analyzed by FMLR in the range of 2-5 min per spectrum to identify and quantify constituents present at concentrations of 0.2 mM or greater.},

abstract = {Time-zero 2D 13C HSQC (HSQC0) spectrosco- py offers advantages over traditional 2D NMR for quantitative analysis of solutions containing a mixture of compounds because the signal intensities are directly proportional to the concentra- tions of the constituents.TheHSQC0 spectrumis derived froma series of spectra collected with increasing repetition times within the basic HSQC block by extrapolating the repetition time to zero. Here we present an alternative approach to data collection, in Metabolite Mixtures by Gradient-Selective Time-Zero 1H13C HSQC with Two Concentration References and Fast Maximum Likelihood Reconstruction Analysis gradient-selective time-zero 1H13C HSQC0 in combination with fast maximum likelihood reconstruction (FMLR) data analysis and the use of two concentration references for absolute concentration determination. Gradient-selective data acquisition results in cleaner spectra, and NMR data can be acquired in both constant-time and non-constant-time mode. Semiautomatic data analysis is supported by the FMLR approach, which is used to deconvolute the spectra and extract peak volumes. The peak volumes obtained from this analysis are converted to absolute concentrations by reference to the peak volumes of two internal reference compounds of known concentration: DSS (4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonic acid) at the low concentration limit (which also serves as chemical shift reference) and MES (2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid) at the high concentration limit. The linear relationship between peak volumes and concentration is better defined with two references than with one, and the measured absolute concentrations of individual compounds in the mixture are more accurate. We compare results fromsemiautomated gsHSQC0 with those obtained by the original manual phase-cycled HSQC0 approach. The new approach is suitable for automatic metabolite profiling by simultaneous quantification of multiple metabolites in a complex mixture},

Because the sensitivity of the SQUID is frequency independent, we enhanced both signal-to-noise ratio and spectral resolution by detecting the NMR signal in extremely low magnetic fields, where the NMR lines become very narrow even for grossly inhomogeneous measurement fields. In the absence of chemical shifts, proton-phosphorous scalar (J) couplings have been detected, indicating the presence of specific covalent bonds. This observation opens the possibility for "pure J spectroscopy" as a diagnostic tool for the detection of molecules in low magnetic fields.},

@article{Jasra2005,
abstract = {In the past ten years there has been a dramatic increase of interest in the Bayesian analysis of ﬁnite mixture models. This is primarily because of the emergence of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Whilst MCMC provides a convenient way to draw inference from complicated statistical models, there are many, perhaps under appreciated, problems associated with the MCMC analysis of mixtures. The problems are mainly caused by the nonidentiﬁability of the components under symmetric priors, which leads to so called label switching in the MCMC output. This will mean that ergodic averages of component speciﬁc quantities will be identical and thus useless for inference. We review the solutions to the label switching problem, such as artiﬁcial identiﬁability constraints (e.g. Diebolt \& Robert (1994)), relabelling algorithms (Stephens 1997a) and label invariant loss functions (Celeux, Hurn \& Robert 2000). We also review various MCMC sampling schemes that have been suggested for mixture models and discuss posterior sensitivity to prior speciﬁcation.},

We show that in the Earth's field the transverse relaxation time T2 of the 7Li nucleus is very sensitive to its mobility in solution. The J-coupling constants3 of silicon-containing (29Si) and fluorine-containing molecules are measured with just a single scan. The accuracy of the measured 1H–29Si and 1H–19F J-coupling constants is between a few millihertz up to 20 mHz. This is at least one order of magnitude better than the precision obtained with superconducting magnets. The high precision allows the discrimination of similar chemical structures of small molecules as well as of macromolecules.},

@article{Rakus2009,
abstract = {The structure of an uncharacterized member of the enolase superfamily from Oceanobacillus iheyensis (GI 23100298, IMG locus tag Ob2843, PDB entry 2OQY ) was determined by the New York SGX Research Center for Structural Genomics (NYSGXRC). The structure contained two Mg(2+) ions located 10.4 A from one another, with one located in the canonical position in the (beta/alpha)(7)beta-barrel domain (although the ligand at the end of the fifth beta-strand is His, unprecedented in structurally characterized members of the superfamily); the second is located in a novel site within the capping domain. In silico docking of a library of mono- and diacid sugars to the active site predicted a diacid sugar as a likely substrate. Activity screening of a physical library of acid sugars identified galactarate as the substrate (k(cat) = 6.8 s(-1), K(M) = 620 microM, k(cat)/K(M) = 1.1 x 10(4) M(-1) s(-1)), allowing functional assignment of Ob2843 as galactarate dehydratase (GalrD-II). The structure of a complex of the catalytically impaired Y90F mutant with Mg(2+) and galactarate allowed identification of a Tyr 164-Arg 162 dyad as the base that initiates the reaction by abstraction of the alpha-proton and Tyr 90 as the acid that facilitates departure of the beta-OH leaving group. The enzyme product is 2-keto-d-threo-4,5-dihydroxyadipate, the enantiomer of the product obtained in the GalrD reaction catalyzed by a previously characterized bifunctional l-talarate/galactarate dehydratase (TalrD/GalrD). On the basis of the different active site structures and different regiochemistries, we recognize that these functions represent an example of apparent, not actual, convergent evolution of function. The structure of GalrD-II and its active site architecture allow identification of the seventh functionally and structurally characterized subgroup in the enolase superfamily. This study provides an additional example in which an integrated sequence- and structure-based strategy employing computational approaches is a viable approach for directing functional assignment of unknown enzymes discovered in genome projects.},

abstract = {A total of 207 volatile compounds were identified in extracts of four French labeled brandies: Armagnac, Cognac, Calvados, and Mirabelle. Relative levels of all components were determined using GC-MS after integration of a selected peak of the mass spectrum of each. Each type of brandy could be clearly discriminated using PLS-DA statistical analyses based on these levels. French Mirabelle spirit, which was studied for the first time, was characterized by higher levels of many aldehydes and acetals and by the presence of compounds having an odd number of carbons together with benzaldehyde and some of its derivatives. Many possible derivatives of acrolein and high amounts of butan-2-ol were rather specific for the volatile composition of Calvados. The most important difference between the two wine-based samples seemed to be directly linked to the distillation system used. Many furanic compounds are specific to Cognac, whereas two or three compounds such as 1-(ethoxyethoxy)-2-methylbutane and gamma-eudesmol were specific to Armagnac. These two brandies presented rather high distributions of isobutanol and isopentanols, whereas Mirabelle and Calvados compositions offer more concentrated aliphatic linear alcohols.},

Equally, the experiment allows a significant increase in digital resolution or a moderate senstitivity enhancement in the same overall experiment time compared to a conventional HSQC. The gain is a consequence of keeping all unused proton magnetization along z during acquisition, so that the previously reported ASAP and ALSOFAST approaches can be transferred from HMQC to HSQC-type experiments. Next to basic and broadband pulse sequences, a characterization of the sequence with respect to minimum measurement time, sensitivity gain, and advantages in resolution compared to state-of-the-art experiments is given.},

In practice, however, conventional approaches to NMR that utilize the fast Fourier transform, which require data collected at uniform time intervals, result in prohibitively lengthy data collection times in order to achieve the full resolution afforded by high field magnets. A variety of approaches that involve nonuniform sampling have been proposed, each utilizing a non-Fourier method of spectrum analysis. A very general non-Fourier method that is capable of utilizing data collected using any of the proposed nonuniform sampling strategies is maximum entropy reconstruction. A limiting factor in the adoption of maximum entropy reconstruction in NMR has been the need to specify non-intuitive parameters. Here we describe a fully automated system for maximum entropy reconstruction that requires no user-specified parameters. A web-accessible script generator provides the user interface to the system.},

Measurements of the change in conformational stability, delta (delta G), for the mutation of a hydrogen bonded residue to one incapable of hydrogen bonding suggest a stabilization of 1.0 kcal/mol per hydrogen bond. If the delta (delta G) values are corrected for differences in side-chain hydrophobicity and conformational entropy, then the estimated stabilization becomes 2.2 kcal/mol per hydrogen bond.

Unlike the linear hidden Markov models used to model individual protein families, HMMSTR has a highly branched topology and captures recurrent local features of protein sequences and structures that transcend protein family boundaries. The model extends the I-sites library by describing the adjacencies of different sequence-structure motifs as observed in the protein database and, by representing overlapping motifs in a much more compact form, achieves a great reduction in parameters. The HMM attributes a considerably higher probability to coding sequence than does an equivalent dipeptide model, predicts secondary structure with an accuracy of 74.3 \%, backbone torsion angles better than any previously reported method and the structural context of beta strands and turns with an accuracy that should be useful for tertiary structure prediction.},

Nevertheless, we still know little about how proteins fold and unfold in their natural biological habitat: the living cell. Indeed, a variety of cellular components, including molecular chaperones, the ribosome, and crowding of the intracellular medium, modulate folding mechanisms in physiologically relevant environments. This review focuses on the current state of knowledge in protein folding in the cell with emphasis on the early stage of a protein's life, as the nascent polypeptide traverses and emerges from the ribosomal tunnel. Given the vectorial nature of ribosome-assisted translation, the transient degree of chain elongation becomes a relevant variable expected to affect nascent protein foldability, aggregation propensity and extent of interaction with chaperones and the ribosome.},

abstract = {A novel experiment is described for measurements of amide proton exchange rates in proteins with a time resolution of about 1 s. A flow apparatus was used to expose protein solutions in 2H2O first to high temperature for a predetermined time period, during which 1H-2H exchange proceeded, and then to ice-water. The technique was applied for exchange studies in thermally unfolded, selectively reduced basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor. Measurements were made by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance after the exchange was quenched by rapid cooling. Thereby, the sequence-specific resonance assignments for the folded protein could be used, which had been previously obtained. The results of this study indicate that the exchange rates in the thermally unfolded protein are close to those expected for a random chain and that the NH exchange is catalyzed by 2H+ and O2H- up to high temperature, with no significant contributions from p2H-independent catalysis. We conclude that the parameters derived by Molday et al. [Molday, R. S., Englander, S. W., \& Kallen, R. G. (1972) Biochemistry 11, 150-158] from measurements with small model peptides can be used to calculate intrinsic exchange rates in unfolded proteins and thus provide a reliable reference for the interpretation of exchange rates measured under native conditions.},

abstract = {The resolution of spectral frequencies in NMR data obtained from discrete Fourier transformation (DFT) along D constant-time dimensions can be improved significantly through extrapolation of the D-dimensional free induction decay (FID) by multidimensional Bayesian analysis. Starting from Bayesian probability theory for parameter estimation and model detection of one-dimensional time-domain data [Bretthorst, (1990) J. Magn. Reson., 88, 533-551; 552-570; 571-595], a theory for the D-dimensional case has been developed and implemented in an algorithm called BAMBAM (BAyesian Model Building Algorithm in Multidimensions). BAMBAM finds the most probable sinusoidal model to account for the systematic portion of any D-dimensional stationary FID. According to the parameters estimated by the algorithm, the FID is extrapolated in D dimensions prior to apodization and Fourier transformation. Multidimensional Bayesian analysis allows for the detection of signals not resolved by the DFT alone or even by sequential one-dimensional extrapolation from mirror-image linear prediction prior to the DFT. The procedure has been tested with a theoretical two-dimensional dataset and with four-dimensional HN(CO)CAHA (Kay et al. (1992) J. Magn. Reson., 98, 443-450) data from a small protein (8 kDa) where BAMBAM was applied to the 13C alpha and H alpha constant-time dimensions.},

abstract = {It is well established that non-uniform sampling (NUS) allows acquisition of multi-dimensional NMR spectra at a resolution that cannot be obtained with traditional uniform acquisition through the indirect dimensions. However, the impact of NUS on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and sensitivity are less well documented. SNR and sensitivity are essential aspects of NMR experiments as they define the quality and extent of data that can be obtained. This is particularly important for spectroscopy with low concentration samples of biological macromolecules. There are different ways of defining the SNR depending on how to measure the noise, and the distinction between SNR and sensitivity is often not clear. While there are defined procedures for measuring sensitivity with high concentration NMR standards, such as sucrose, there is no clear or generally accepted definition of sensitivity when comparing different acquisition and processing methods for spectra of biological macromolecules with many weak signals close to the level of noise. Here we propose tools for estimating the SNR and sensitivity of NUS spectra with respect to sampling schedule and reconstruction method. We compare uniformly acquired spectra with NUS spectra obtained in the same total measuring time. The time saving obtained when only 1/k of the Nyquist grid points are sampled is used to measure k-fold more scans per increment. We show that judiciously chosen NUS schedules together with suitable reconstruction methods can yield a significant increase of the SNR within the same total measurement time. Furthermore, we propose to define the sensitivity as the probability to detect weak peaks and show that time-equivalent NUS can considerably increase this detection sensitivity. The sensitivity gain increases with the number of NUS indirect dimensions. Thus, well-chosen NUS schedules and reconstruction methods can significantly increase the information content of multidimensional NMR spectra of challenging biological macromolecules.},

A method, developed by Lebihan et al., consists of an extension of the classical matrix filtering method. It is based on the lower rank-(K1, ..., KN) truncation of the HOSVD which performs a multimode principal component analysis (PCA) and is implicitly developed for a white Gaussian noise model. Two new tensor filtering methods developed by the authors are also reviewed. The first consists of an improvement of the multimode PCA-based tensor filtering in the case of an additive correlated Gaussian noise model. This improvement is especially done thanks to the fourth-order cumulant slice matrix. The second method consists an extension of the Wiener filtering for data tensor. The performances and comparative results between all these tensor filtering methods are presented in the case of noise reduction in color images and multicomponent seismic data. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

NMR spectroscopy can probe hydrogen bond deformations at very high resolution through hydrogen bond scalar couplings (HBCs). However, the small size of HBCs has so far prevented a comprehensive quantitative characterization of protein hydrogen bonds as a function of the basic thermodynamic parameters of pressure and temperature. Using a newly developed pressure cell, we have now mapped pressure- and temperature-dependent changes of 31 hydrogen bonds in ubiquitin by measuring HBCs with very high precision. Short-range hydrogen bonds are only moderately perturbed, but many hydrogen bonds with large sequence separations (high contact order) show greater changes. In contrast, other high-contact-order hydrogen bonds remain virtually unaffected. The specific stabilization of such topologically important connections may present a general principle with which to achieve protein stability and to preserve structural integrity during protein function.},

abstract = {The Fourier transform has been the gold standard for transforming data from the time domain to the frequency domain in many spectroscopic methods, including NMR spectroscopy. While reliable, it has the drawback that it requires a grid of uniformely sampled data points, which is not efficient for decaying signals, and it also suffers from artifacts when dealing with nondecaying signals. Over several decades, many alternative sampling and transformation schemes have been proposed. Their common problem is that relative signal amplitudes are not well-preserved. Here we demonstrate the superior performance of a sine-weighted Poisson-gap distribution sparse-sampling scheme combined with forward maximum entropy (FM) reconstruction. While the relative signal amplitudes are well-preserved, we also find that the signal-to-noise ratio is enhanced up to 4-fold per unit of data acquisition time relative to traditional linear sampling.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Analysis of the plethora of metabolites found in the NMR spectra of biological fluids or tissues requires data complexity to be simplified. We present a graphical user interface (GUI) for NMR-based metabonomic analysis. The "Metabonomic Package" has been developed for metabonomics research as open-source software and uses the R statistical libraries. RESULTS: The package offers the following options: Raw 1-dimensional spectra processing: phase, baseline correction and normalization. Importing processed spectra. Including/excluding spectral ranges, optional binning and bucketing, detection and alignment of peaks. Sorting of metabolites based on their ability to discriminate, metabolite selection, and outlier identification. Multivariate unsupervised analysis: principal components analysis (PCA). Multivariate supervised analysis: partial least squares (PLS), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), k-nearest neighbor classification. Neural networks.Visualization and overlapping of spectra. Plot values of the chemical shift position for different samples. Furthermore, the "Metabonomic" GUI includes a console to enable other kinds of analyses and to take advantage of all R statistical tools. CONCLUSION: We made complex multivariate analysis user-friendly for both experienced and novice users, which could help to expand the use of NMR-based metabonomics.},

abstract = {Despite significant advances in automated nuclear magnetic resonance-based protein structure determination, the high numbers of false positives and false negatives among the peaks selected by fully automated methods remain a problem. These false positives and negatives impair the performance of resonance assignment methods. One of the main reasons for this problem is that the computational research community often considers peak picking and resonance assignment to be two separate problems, whereas spectroscopists use expert knowledge to pick peaks and assign their resonances at the same time. We propose a novel framework that simultaneously conducts slice picking and spin system forming, an essential step in resonance assignment. Our framework then employs a genetic algorithm, directed by both connectivity information and amino acid typing information from the spin systems, to assign the spin systems to residues. The inputs to our framework can be as few as two commonly used spectra, i.e., CBCA(CO)NH and HNCACB. Different from the existing peak picking and resonance assignment methods that treat peaks as the units, our method is based on 'slices', which are one-dimensional vectors in three-dimensional spectra that correspond to certain ([Formula: see text]) values. Experimental results on both benchmark simulated data sets and four real protein data sets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods while using a less number of spectra than those methods. Our method is freely available at http://sfb.kaust.edu.sa/Pages/Software.aspx.},

The results reveal vibrational spectra of solvation-shell molecules that are perturbed by each solute. The perturbed solvent-shell water molecules are found to have different OH stretch bands (of higher frequency and narrower width than bulk water), and the gauche-trans equilibrium of solvent-shell DCE molecules are perturbed in opposite directions by the polar and nonpolar solutes.},

IR spectroscopy and electrochemical analysis were used to evaluate the electronic structure of these proton-reducing molecular electrocatalysts. The increase in the number of electron-withdrawing groups upon the electrocatalyst leads to an anodic shift in reduction potential and a concomitant lowering of the overpotential of hydrogen evolution. An overpotential of just 0.39 V is observed for 5 with acetic acid (pKa = 22.3 in acetonitrile).},

abstract = {The Nyquist theorem stipulates the largest sampling interval sufficient to avoid aliasing is the reciprocal of the spectral bandwidth. When data are not sampled uniformly, the Nyquist theorem no longer applies, and aliasing phenomena become more complex. For samples selected from an evenly spaced grid, signals that are within the nominal bandwidth of the grid can give rise to aliases. The effective bandwidth afforded by a set of nonuniformly sampled evolution times does not necessarily correspond to spacing of the grid from which the samples are selected, but instead depends on the actual distribution of sample times. For conventional uniform sampling there is no distinction between the grid spacing and the sampling interval. For nonuniform sampling, an effective bandwidth can be inferred from the greatest common divisor of the sample times, provided that none of the sample times are irrational. A simple way to increase the effective bandwidth for a set of nonuniformly spaced samples is to randomly select them from an oversampled grid. For a given grid spacing, "bursty" sampling helps to minimize aliasing artifacts. We show that some spectral artifacts arising from nonuniform sampling are aliases, and that increasing the effective bandwidth shifts these artifacts out of the spectral window and improves spectral quality. An advantage of nonuniform sampling is that some of the benefits of oversampling can be realized without incurring experiment time or resolution penalties. We illustrate the improvements that can be obtained with nonuniform sampling in the indirect dimension of a SOFAST-HMQC experiment. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {MetaboNexus is an interactive metabolomics data analysis platform that integrates pre-processing of raw peak data with in-depth statistical analysis and metabolite identity search. It is designed to work as a desktop appli- cation hence uploading large ﬁles to web servers is not required. This could speed up the data analysis process because server queries or queues are avoided, while ensuring security of conﬁdential clinical data on a local computer. With MetaboNexus, users can progressively start from data pre-processing, multi- and univariate ana- lysis to metabolite identity search of signiﬁcant molecular features, thereby seamlessly integrating critical steps for metabolite biomarker discovery. Data exploration can be ﬁrst performed using principal components analysis, while prediction and variable importance can be calculated using partial least squares-discriminant analysis and Random Forest. After identifying putative features from multi- and univariate analyses (e.g. t test, ANOVA, Mann–Whitney U test and Kruskal–Wallis test), users can seamlessly deter- mine the molecular identity of these putative features. To assist users in data interpretation, MetaboNexus also automatically generates graphical outputs, such as score plots, diagnostic plots, boxplots, receiver operating char- acteristic plots and heatmaps. The metabolite search function will match the mass spectrometric peak data to three major metabolite repositories, namely HMDB, MassBank and METLIN, using a comprehensive range of molecular adducts. Biological pathways can also be sear- ched within MetaboNexus. MetaboNexus is available with installation guide and tutorial at http://www.sph.nus.edu. sg/index.php/research-services/research-centres/ceohr/meta bonexus, and is meant for the Windows Operating System, XP and onwards (preferably on 64-bit). In summary, MetaboNexus is a desktop-based platform that seamlessly integrates the entire data analytical workﬂow and fur- ther provides the putative identities of mass spectrometric data peaks by matching them to databases.},

@article{Nikolaidis2012,
abstract = {The central aim of this review is to address the highly multidisciplinary topic of redox biology as related to exercise using an integrative and comparative approach rather than focusing on blood, skeletal muscle or humans. An attempt is also made to re-define 'oxidative stress' as well as to introduce the term 'alterations in redox homeostasis' to describe changes in redox homeostasis indicating oxidative stress, reductive stress or both. The literature analysis shows that the effects of non-muscle-damaging exercise and muscle-damaging exercise on redox homeostasis are completely different. Non-muscle-damaging exercise induces alterations in redox homeostasis that last a few hours post exercise, whereas muscle-damaging exercise causes alterations in redox homeostasis that may persist for and/or appear several days post exercise. Both exhaustive maximal exercise lasting only 30 s and isometric exercise lasting 1-3 min (the latter activating in addition a small muscle mass) induce systemic oxidative stress. With the necessary modifications, exercise is capable of inducing redox homeostasis alterations in all fluids, cells, tissues and organs studied so far, irrespective of strains and species. More importantly, 'exercise-induced oxidative stress' is not an 'oddity' associated with a particular type of exercise, tissue or species. Rather, oxidative stress constitutes a ubiquitous fundamental biological response to the alteration of redox homeostasis imposed by exercise. The hormesis concept could provide an interpretative framework to reconcile differences that emerge among studies in the field of exercise redox biology. Integrative and comparative approaches can help determine the interactions of key redox responses at multiple levels of biological organization.},

@article{Bloch1957,
abstract = {This paper represents a further generalization, beyond that given recently, of an earlier theory by Wangsness and the author. In common with this theory, it is assumed that the spin system is weakly coupled to its molecular surroundings and that the latter can be considered as a heat reservoir which remains in thermal equilibrium at the absolute temperature T. The condition that the coupling is weak demands that its effects upon the spin system, calculated in first and second approximation and measured in a frequency scale, are small compared to the inverse of the correlation time $\tau$c as well as of the time $\beta$=ℏ/kT. The principal progress over the earlier work consists in the fact that it imposes no additional conditions upon the energy of the spin system; in particular, it dispenses with the necessity that the dominant part of this energy is independent of the time. A linear differential equation of the first order for the distribution matrix is derived which is valid in this very general case and which contains the earlier results as special cases. The derivation of this Boltzmann equation is carried out in a form which is independent of any particular representation, used for the spin system, and which leads directly to a system of differential equations for the expectation values of spin functions. Beyond the earlier results, it is shown that the coupling with the molecular surroundings leads in second approximation not only to relaxation terms but also to a correction of the spin energy which has the nature of a "self-energy." As a considerably more restricted case, the situation is investigated where the dominant part of the spin energy varies little during a time of order $\tau$c and $\beta$. It is shown that, in this case, relaxation causes the distribution matrix to tend towards the form, corresponding to thermal equilibrium at the instantaneous value of the dominant part of the energy. The case where the frequencies of the spin system as well as their relative rate of variation are small compared to 1/$\tau$c but arbitrary compared to 1/$\beta$, is likewise discussed and shown to lead to a simple form of the Boltzmann equation. The general formalism is finally applied to a spin system with a single spin of value ½, exposed to a rotating field. One obtains in this case a phenomenological equation for the expectation value of the spin vector which is far more general than the one derived earlier; instead of requiring merely the knowledge of the longitudinal and the transverse relaxation time, relaxation is here characterized by five time constants which may all be different. The stationary solution is derived and applied to a number of familiar special cases.},

abstract = {In complex biological or colloidal samples, magnetic relaxation dispersion (MRD) experiments using the field-cycling technique can characterize molecular motions on time scales ranging from nanoseconds to microseconds, provided that a rigorous theory of nuclear spin relaxation is available. In gels, cross-linked proteins, and biological tissues, where an immobilized macromolecular component coexists with a mobile solvent phase, nuclear spins residing in solvent (or cosolvent) species relax predominantly via exchange-mediated orientational randomization (EMOR) of anisotropic nuclear (electric quadrupole or magnetic dipole) couplings. The physical or chemical exchange processes that dominate the MRD typically occur on a time scale of microseconds or longer, where the conventional perturbation theory of spin relaxation breaks down. There is thus a need for a more general relaxation theory. Such a theory, based on the stochastic Liouville equation (SLE) for the EMOR mechanism, is available for a single quadrupolar spin I = 1. Here, we present the corresponding theory for a dipole-coupled spin-1/2 pair. To our knowledge, this is the first treatment of dipolar MRD outside the motional-narrowing regime. Based on an analytical solution of the spatial part of the SLE, we show how the integral longitudinal relaxation rate can be computed efficiently. Both like and unlike spins, with selective or non-selective excitation, are treated. For the experimentally important dilute regime, where only a small fraction of the spin pairs are immobilized, we obtain simple analytical expressions for the auto-relaxation and cross-relaxation rates which generalize the well-known Solomon equations. These generalized results will be useful in biophysical studies, e.g., of intermittent protein dynamics. In addition, they represent a first step towards a rigorous theory of water (1)H relaxation in biological tissues, which is a prerequisite for unravelling the molecular basis of soft-tissue contrast in clinical magnetic resonance imaging.},

abstract = {Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectra are widely used in metabolomics to obtain profiles of metabolites dissolved in biofluids such as cell supernatants. Methods for estimating metabolite concentrations from these spectra are presently confined to manual peak fitting and to binning procedures for integrating resonance peaks. Extensive information on the patterns of spectral resonance generated by human metabolites is now available in online databases. By incorporating this information into a Bayesian model we can deconvolve resonance peaks from a spectrum and obtain explicit concentration estimates for the corresponding metabolites. Spectral resonances that cannot be deconvolved in this way may also be of scientific interest so we model them jointly using wavelets. We describe a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm which allows us to sample from the joint posterior distribution of the model parameters, using specifically designed block updates to improve mixing. The strong prior on resonance patterns allows the algorithm to identify peaks corresponding to particular metabolites automatically, eliminating the need for manual peak assignment. We assess our method for peak alignment and concentration estimation. Except sometimes when the target resonance signal is very weak, alignment is unbiased and precise. We compare the Bayesian concentration estimates to those obtained from a conventional numerical integration method and find that our estimates have 11 fold reduced mean estimation error. Finally, we apply our method to a spectral dataset taken from an investigation of the metabolic response of yeast to recombinant protein expression. We compare our results to the manual deconvolutions of an expert spectroscopist and find concurrence except in the case of one compound. We discuss the reason for such discrepancies and the robustness of our methods concentration estimates.},

abstract = {The standard normal variate transform (SNV) is applied to pretreat NIR data for pattern recognition. Eleven NIR data sets are analysed. The results show that SNV improves classification results in most of the cases by reducing the within-class variance. Because of the closure problem, SNV leads to artefacts and is difficult to interpret in simple methods of wavelength distance and univariate direct discrimination (DD). A proposed robust normal variate transform (RNV) gives more reasonable results than SNV. Because of the artefacts, SNV sometimes gives worse results for regularised discriminant analysis (RDA) than using the original data. In this case, RNV leads to improved results, and in general, it performs better than SNV, even when SNV gives better results than using the original data. However, the drawback of RNV is that the applied percentile needs to be optimised. A proposal for quick selection of the percentile is given.},

abstract = {OnPLS was recently presented as a general extension of O2PLS to the multiblock case. OnPLS is very similar to O2PLS in the case of two blocks, but generalises symmetrically to cases with more than two blocks, i.e. without giving preference to any one of the blocks.This article presents a straight-forward extension to this method and thereby also introduces the OPLS framework to the field of PLS path modelling. Path modelling links a number of data blocks to each other, thereby establishing a set of paths along which information is considered to flow between blocks, representing for instance a known time sequence, an assumed causality order, or some other chosen organising principle. Compared to existing methods for path analysis, OnPLS extracts a minimum number of predictive components that are maximally covarying with maximised correlation. This is a significant contribution to path modelling, because other methods may yield score vectors with variation that obstructs the interpretation. The method achieves this by extracting a set of orthogonal components that capture local phenomena orthogonal to the variation shared with all the connected blocks.Two applications will be used to illustrate the method. The first is based on a simulated dataset that shows how the interpretation is improved by removing orthogonal variation and the second on a real data process for the monitoring of protein structure changes during cheese ripening by analysing infrared data. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Multidimensional NMR spectroscopy typically employs phase-sensitive detection, which results in hypercomplex data (and spectra) when utilized in more than one dimension. Nonuniform sampling approaches have become commonplace in multidimensional NMR, enabling dramatic reductions in experiment time, increases in sensitivity and/or increases in resolution. In order to utilize nonuniform sampling optimally, it is necessary to characterize the relationship between the spectrum of a uniformly sampled data set and the spectrum of a subsampled data set. In this work we construct an algebra of hypercomplex numbers suitable for representing multidimensional NMR data along with partial-component nonuniform sampling (i.e. the hypercomplex components of data points are subsampled). This formalism leads to a modified DFT-Convolution relationship involving a partial-component, hypercomplex point-spread function set. The framework presented here is essential for the continued development and appropriate characterization of partial-component nonuniform sampling.© 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {High-resolution (1)H NMR spectroscopy is frequently used in the field of metabolomics to assess the metabolites found in biofluids or tissue extracts to define a metabolic profile that describes a given biological process. In this study, we aimed to increase the utility of NMR-based metabolomics by using advanced Bayesian modeling of the time-domain high-resolution 1D NMR free induction decay (FID). The improvement over traditional nonparametric binning is twofold and associated with enhanced resolution of the analysis and automation of the signal processing stage. The automation is achieved by using a Bayesian formalism for all parameters of the model including the number of components. The approach is illustrated with a study of early markers of acute exposure to different doses of a well-characterized nongenotoxic hepatocarcinogen, phenobarbital, in rats. The results demonstrate that Bayesian deconvolution produces a better model for the NMR spectra that allows the identification of subtle changes in metabolic concentrations and a decrease in the expected false discovery rate compared with approaches based on "binning". These properties suggest that Bayesian deconvolution could facilitate the biomarker discovery process and improve information extraction from high-resolution NMR spectra.},

abstract = {The basic equation describing radiation damping in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is rewritten by means of the reciprocity principle, to remove the dependence of the damping constant upon filling factor - a parameter which is neither uniquely defined for easily measured. The new equation uses instead the transceive efficiency, i.e. the peak amplitude of the radiofrequency B field in laboratory coordinates, divided by the square root of the resistance of the detection coil, for which a simple and direct means of measurement exists. We use the efficiency to define the intrinsic damping constant, i.e. that which obtains when both probe and preamplifier are perfectly matched to the system impedance. For imperfect matching of the preamp, it is shown that the damping constant varies with electrical distance to the probe, and equations are given and simulations performed, to predict the distance dependence, which (for lossless lines) is periodic modulo a half wavelength. Experimental measurements of the radiation-damped free induction NMR signal of protons in neat water are performed at a static B field strength of 14.1 T; and an intrinsic damping constant measured using the variable line method. For a sample of 5 mm diameter, in an inverse detection probe we measure an intrinsic damping constant of 204 s-1, corresponding to a damping linewidth of 65 Hz for small tip angles. The predicted intrinsic linewidth, based upon three separate measurements of the efficiency, is 52.3 Hz, or 80\% of the measured value. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Current clinical strategy for staging and prognostication of colorectal cancer (CRC) relies mainly upon the TNM or Duke system. This clinicopathological stage is a crude prognostic guide because it reflects in part the delay in diagnosis in the case of an advanced cancer and gives little insight into the biological characteristics of the tumor. We hypothesized that global metabolic profiling (metabonomics/metabolomics) of colon mucosae would define metabolic signatures that not only discriminate malignant from normal mucosae, but also could distinguish the anatomical and clinicopathological characteristics of CRC. We applied both high-resolution magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (HR-MAS NMR) and gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC/MS) to analyze metabolites in biopsied colorectal tumors and their matched normal mucosae obtained from 31 CRC patients. Orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) models generated from metabolic profiles obtained by both analytical approaches could robustly discriminate normal from malignant samples (Q(2) > 0.50, Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) AUC >0.95, using 7-fold cross validation). A total of 31 marker metabolites were identified using the two analytical platforms. The majority of these metabolites were associated with expected metabolic perturbations in CRC including elevated tissue hypoxia, glycolysis, nucleotide biosynthesis, lipid metabolism, inflammation and steroid metabolism. OPLS-DA models showed that the metabolite profiles obtained via HR-MAS NMR could further differentiate colon from rectal cancers (Q(2)> 0.60, ROC AUC = 1.00, using 7-fold cross validation). These data suggest that metabolic profiling of CRC mucosae could provide new phenotypic biomarkers for CRC management.},

Such model complexes are expected to further the understanding of the interconversion processes that occur from cellular allowed random coil or alpha-helical conformation into insoluble cell-deleterious beta-pleated-sheet motifs. In the present study, polyalanine-based peptides (i.e., derived from Ac-KA14K-NH2) were designed that underwent conformational changes from monomeric random coil conformations into soluble, macromolecular beta-pleated-sheet complexes without any covalent modification. The interconversion was found to be length-, environment-, and concentration-dependent and to be driven by hydrophobic interactions between the methyl groups of the alanine side chains. A series of substitution analogs of Ac-KA14K-NH2 was used to study the amino acid acceptability within the hydrophobic core of the complex, as well as at both termini. The formation of amyloid plaques in a number of amyloidogenic peptides could be related to the presence of amino acids within their sequences that were found to have a high propensity to occur in these model beta-sheet complexes.},

H(N) atoms are readily recognizable from (1)H/(2)H exchange or (1)H/(15)N heteronuclear single quantum correlation (HSQC) experiments. The primary structure is threaded through the unassigned foc by leapfrogging along peptidyl amide H(N)s and the connected H(alpha)s. Via a Bayesian approach, the probabilities of the sequential connectivity hypotheses are inferred from likelihoods of H(N)/H(N), H(N)/H(alpha), and H(alpha)/H(alpha) interatomic distances as well as (1)H NMR chemical shifts, both derived from public databases. Once the polypeptide sequence is identified, directionality becomes established, and the foc N and C termini are recognized. After a similar procedure, side chain H atoms are found, including discriminated cis/trans proline loci. The folded structure then is derived via a direct molecular dynamics embedding into mirror image-related representations of the foc and selected according to a lowest energy criterion. The method was applied to foc densities calculated for two protein domains, col 2 and kringle 2. The obtained structures are within 1.0-1.5 A (backbone heavy atoms) and 1.5-2.0 A (all heavy atoms) rms deviations from reported x-ray and/or NMR structures.},

abstract = {In general, applications of metabonomics using biofluid NMR spectroscopic analysis for probing abnormal biochemical profiles in disease or due to toxicity have all relied on the use of chemometric techniques for sample classification. However, the well-known variability of some chemical shifts in 1H NMR spectra of biofluids due to environmental differences such as pH variation, when coupled with the large number of variables in such spectra, has led to the situation where it is necessary to reduce the size of the spectra or to attempt to align the shifting peaks, to get more robust and interpretable chemometric models. Here, a new approach that avoids this problem is demonstrated and shows that, moreover, inclusion of variable peak position data can be beneficial and can lead to useful biochemical information. The interpretation of chemometric models using combined back-scaled loading plots and variable weights demonstrates that this peak position variation can be handled successfully and also often provides additional information on the physicochemical variations in metabonomic data sets.},

abstract = {In the analyses of highly complex samples (for example, metabolic fingerprinting), the data might not suffice for classification when using only a single analytical technique. Hence, the use of two complementary techniques, e.g., LC/MS and 1H-NMR, might be advantageous. Another possible advantage from using two different techniques is the ability to verify the results (for instance, by verifying a time trend of a metabolic pattern). In this work, both LC/MS and 1H-NMR data from analysis of rat urine have been used to obtain metabolic fingerprints. A comparison of three different methods for data fusion of the two data sets was performed and the possibilities and difficulties associated with data fusion were discussed. When comparing concatenated data, full hierarchical modeling, and batch modeling, the first two approaches were found to be the most successful. Different types of block scaling and variable scaling were evaluated and the optimal scaling for each case was found by cross validation. Validations of the final models were performed by means of an external test set.22Copies of the Matlab program files used for this work are available from the authors. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {PLS-regression (PLSR) is the PLS approach in its simplest, and in chemistry and technology, most used form (two-block predictive PLS). PLSR is a method for relating two data matrices, X and Y, by a linear multivariate model, but goes beyond traditional regression in that it models also the structure of X and Y. PLSR derives its usefulness from its ability to analyze data with many, noisy, collinear, and even incomplete variables in both X and Y. PLSR has the desirable property that the precision of the model parameters improves with the increasing number of relevant variables and observations. This article reviews PLSR as it has developed to become a standard tool in chemometrics and used in chemistry and engineering. The underlying model and its assumptions are discussed, and commonly used diagnostics are reviewed together with the interpretation of resulting parameters. Two examples are used as illustrations: First, a Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR)/Quantitative Structure-Property Relationship (QSPR) data set of peptides is used to outline how to develop, interpret and refine a PLSR model. Second, a data set from the manufacturing of recycled paper is analyzed to illustrate time series modelling of process data by means of PLSR and time-lagged X-variables. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

The most common way of making a glass is by cooling a viscous liquid fast enough to avoid crystallization. Although this route to the vitreous state-supercooling-has been known for millennia, the molecular processes by which liquids acquire amorphous rigidity upon cooling are not fully understood. Here we discuss current theoretical knowledge of the manner in which intermolecular forces give rise to complex behaviour in supercooled liquids and glasses. An intriguing aspect of this behaviour is the apparent connection between dynamics and thermodynamics. The multidimensional potential energy surface as a function of particle coordinates (the energy landscape) offers a convenient viewpoint for the analysis and interpretation of supercooling and glass-formation phenomena. That much of this analysis is at present largely qualitative reflects the fact that precise computations of how viscous liquids sample their landscape have become possible only recently.},

In this report, crystal structures have been solved for the apoenzyme, binary complexes of the enzyme with reduced cofactor or 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA substrate, and an abortive ternary complex of the enzyme with NAD(+) and acetoacetyl-CoA. The models illustrate positioning of cofactor and substrate within the active site of the enzyme. Comparison of these structures with the previous model of the enzyme-NAD(+) complex reveals that although significant shifting of the NAD(+)-binding domain relative to the C-terminal domain occurs in the ternary and substrate-bound complexes, there are few differences between the apoenzyme and cofactor-bound complexes. Analysis of these models clarifies the role of key amino acids implicated in catalysis and highlights additional critical residues. Furthermore, a novel charge transfer complex has been identified in the course of abortive ternary complex formation, and its characterization provides additional insight into aspects of the catalytic mechanism of l-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase.},

The pulse sequence incorporates a modification of the last WET selective pulse to accommodate insertion of a toggled 180 degrees inversion pulse so that the original WET selective pulse angles are effectively preserved. Compared with existing WET methods, WET180 has the advantages of easy implementation, improved residual water suppression, clean spectral phase properties, and good signal intensity retention. WET180 is expected to be most useful in observing resonances close to water in samples containing biological molecules. In addition, the principle of WET180 can be applied in multidimensional experiments to improve residual water suppression and reduce artifacts around water.},

abstract = {Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) has been available for nearly 20 years yet is poorly understood by most users. By simple examples, it is shown graphically and algebraically that for two equal class sizes, PLS-DA using one partial least squares (PLS) component provides equivalent classification results to Euclidean distance to centroids, and by using all nonzero components to linear discriminant analysis. Extensions where there are unequal class sizes and more than two classes are discussed including common pitfalls and dilemmas. Finally, the problems of overfitting and PLS scores plots are discussed. It is concluded that for classification purposes, PLS-DA has no significant advantages over traditional procedures and is an algorithm full of dangers. It should not be viewed as a single integrated method but as step in a full classification procedure. However, despite these limitations, PLS-DA can provide good insight into the causes of discrimination via weights and loadings, which gives it a unique role in exploratory data analysis, for example in metabolomics via visualisation of significant variables such as metabolites or spectroscopic peaks.},

abstract = {For the analysis of the spectra of complex biofluids, preprocessing methods play a crucial role in rendering the subsequent data analyses more robust and accurate. Normalization is a preprocessing method, which accounts for different dilutions of samples by scaling the spectra to the same virtual overall concentration. In the field of 1H NMR metabonomics integral normalization, which scales spectra to the same total integral, is the de facto standard. In this work, it is shown that integral normalization is a suboptimal method for normalizing spectra from metabonomic studies. Especially strong metabonomic changes, evident as massive amounts of single metabolites in samples, significantly hamper the integral normalization resulting in incorrectly scaled spectra. The probabilistic quotient normalization is introduced in this work. This method is based on the calculation of a most probable dilution factor by looking at the distribution of the quotients of the amplitudes of a test spectrum by those of a reference spectrum. Simulated spectra, spectra of urine samples from a metabonomic study with cyclosporin-A as the active compound, and spectra of more than 4000 samples of control animals demonstrate that the probabilistic quotient normalization is by far more robust and more accurate than the widespread integral normalization and vector length normalization.},

abstract = {The interpretation of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experimental results for metabolomics studies requires intensive signal processing and multivariate data analysis techniques. A key step in this process is the quantification of spectral features, which is commonly accomplished by dividing an NMR spectrum into several hundred integral regions or bins. Binning attempts to minimize effects from variations in peak positions caused by sample pH, ionic strength, and composition, while reducing the dimensionality for multivariate statistical analyses. Herein we develop an improved novel spectral quantification technique, dynamic adaptive binning. With this technique, bin boundaries are determined by optimizing an objective function using a dynamic programming strategy. The objective function measures the quality of a bin configuration based on the number of peaks per bin. This technique shows a significant improvement over both traditional uniform binning and other adaptive binning techniques. This improvement is quantified via synthetic validation sets by analyzing an algorithm's ability to create bins that do not contain more than a single peak and that maximize the distance from peak to bin boundary. The validation sets are developed by characterizing the salient distributions in experimental NMR spectroscopic data. Further, dynamic adaptive binning is applied to a (1)H NMR-based experiment to monitor rat urinary metabolites to empirically demonstrate improved spectral quantification.},

Such experiments have been collected traditionally as an array of one-dimensional scans, with suitably incremented delay parameters that encode along independent temporal domains the nD spectral distribution being sought. During the past few years, an ultrafast approach to nD NMR has been introduced that is capable of delivering any type of multidimensional spectrum in a single transient. This method operates by departing from the canonical nD NMR scheme and by replacing its temporal encoding with a series of spatial manipulations derived from magnetic resonance imaging. The present survey introduces the main principles of this subsecond approach to spectroscopy, focusing on the applications that have hitherto been demonstrated for single-scan two-dimensional NMR in different areas of chemistry.},

The centers of these distributions were 5.60 ns for HSA, 4.23 ns for FDB-HSA, and 6.08 ns for Met-218 HSA. The global rotational correlation times of the three HSAs were near 41 ns while the amplitude and rate of the local motion varied. These changes in the lifetimes and mobilities suggest perturbation in the local protein environment near tryptophan 214 as a consequence of the amino acid substitutions.},

abstract = {In order to analyze NMR relaxation data in terms of parameters which describe internal motion, one must first obtain a description of the overall tumbling of the macromolecule in solution. Methods currently used to estimate these global parameters may not always provide reliable estimates of their values and uncertainties. In this paper, we present a general data analysis formalism based on products of Bayesian marginal probability densities which can be used to efficiently combine the information content from multiple experiments, such as R(1), R(2), and NOE data collected at multiple magnetic field strengths, or data from cross-correlation or rotating frame relaxation dispersion experiments. Our approach allows the estimation of global tumbling and internal dynamical parameters and their uncertainties without some of the assumptions which are made in the commonly-used methods for model-selection and global parameter estimation. Compared to an equivalent classical statistical approach, the Bayesian method not only is more computationally efficient, but also provides greater insight into the information content of the data. We demonstrate that this approach can be used to estimate both the isotropic rotational correlation time in the context of the original and "extended" Lipari-Szabo formalisms [Lipari \& Szabo, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982, 104, 4546; Clore et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990, 112, 4989], as well as the rotational diffusion coefficients for axially symmetric anisotropic tumbling.},

abstract = {Metabolomics studies generate increasingly complex data tables, which are hard to summarize and visualize without appropriate tools. The use of chemometrics tools, e.g., principal component analysis (PCA), partial least-squares to latent structures (PLS), and orthogonal PLS (OPLS), is therefore of great importance as these include efficient, validated, and robust methods for modeling information-rich chemical and biological data. Here the S-plot is proposed as a tool for visualization and interpretation of multivariate classification models, e.g., OPLS discriminate analysis, having two or more classes. The S-plot visualizes both the covariance and correlation between the metabolites and the modeled class designation. Thereby the S-plot helps identifying statistically significant and potentially biochemically significant metabolites, based both on contributions to the model and their reliability. An extension of the S-plot, the SUS-plot (shared and unique structure), is applied to compare the outcome of multiple classification models compared to a common reference, e.g., control. The used example is a gas chromatography coupled mass spectroscopy based metabolomics study in plant biology where two different transgenic poplar lines are compared to wild type. By using OPLS, an improved visualization and discrimination of interesting metabolites could be demonstrated.},

abstract = {Cytochrome P450cam catalyzes the hydroxylation of camphor in a complex process involving two electron transfers (ETs) from the iron-sulfur protein putidaredoxin. The enzymatic control of the successive steps of catalysis is critical for a highly efficient reaction. The injection of the successive electrons is part of the control system. To understand the molecular interactions between putidaredoxin and cytochrome P450cam, we determined the structure of the complex both in solution and in the crystal state. Paramagnetic NMR spectroscopy using lanthanide tags yielded 446 structural restraints that were used to determine the solution structure. An ensemble of 10 structures with an RMSD of 1.3 \AA was obtained. The crystal structure of the complex was solved, showing a position of putidaredoxin that is identical with the one in the solution structure. The NMR data further demonstrate the presence of a minor state or set of states of the complex in solution, which is attributed to the presence of an encounter complex. The structure of the major state shows a small binding interface and a metal-to-metal distance of 16 \AA, with two pathways that provide strong electronic coupling of the redox centers. The interpretation of these results is discussed in the context of ET. The structure indicates that the ET rate can be much faster than the reported value, suggesting that the process may be gated. © 2013. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Here we show that they can. By applying a magnetic-field pulse to a Dy2Ti2O7 spin-ice crystal at 0.36 K, we create a relaxing magnetic current that lasts for several minutes. We measure the current by means of the electromotive force it induces in a solenoid coupled to a sensitive amplifier, and quantitatively describe it using a chemical kinetic model of point-like charges obeying the Onsager-Wien mechanism of carrier dissociation and recombination. We thus derive the microscopic parameters of monopole motion in spin ice and identify the distinct roles of free and bound magnetic charges. Our results illustrate a basic capacitor effect for magnetic charge and should pave the way for the design and realization of 'magnetronic' circuitry.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Picking peaks from experimental NMR spectra is a key unsolved problem for automated NMR protein structure determination. Such a process is a prerequisite for resonance assignment, nuclear overhauser enhancement (NOE) distance restraint assignment, and structure calculation tasks. Manual or semi-automatic peak picking, which is currently the prominent way used in NMR labs, is tedious, time consuming and costly. RESULTS: We introduce new ideas, including noise-level estimation, component forming and sub-division, singular value decomposition (SVD)-based peak picking and peak pruning and refinement. PICKY is developed as an automated peak picking method. Different from the previous research on peak picking, we provide a systematic study of the proposed method. PICKY is tested on 32 real 2D and 3D spectra of eight target proteins, and achieves an average of 88\% recall and 74\% precision. PICKY is efficient. It takes PICKY on average 15.7 s to process an NMR spectrum. More important than these numbers, PICKY actually works in practice. We feed peak lists generated by PICKY to IPASS for resonance assignment, feed IPASS assignment to SPARTA for fragments generation, and feed SPARTA fragments to FALCON for structure calculation. This results in high-resolution structures of several proteins, for example, TM1112, at 1.25 A. AVAILABILITY: PICKY is available upon request. The peak lists of PICKY can be easily loaded by SPARKY to enable a better interactive strategy for rapid peak picking.},

abstract = {To reveal its flavor, coffee has to be roasted. In fact, the green coffee bean contains all ingredients necessary for the later development of coffee flavor. It is now widely accepted that free amino acids and peptides are required for the generation of coffee aroma. However, the mechanisms leading to defined mixtures of free amino acids and peptides remain unknown. Information pertaining to the identification of precursor proteins is also lacking. To answer some of these questions, two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE) was used to follow the fate of green coffee proteins. Two conditions were considered: roasting and incubation of green coffee suspensions at 37 degrees C. Coffee beans were observed to acquire the potential to spontaneously release H(2)O(2) upon polymerization of their proteins during roasting. Fragmentation of proteins was also observed. Conversely, H(2)O(2) was found to control polymerization and fragmentation of green coffee proteins in solution at 37 degrees C. Polymerization and fragmentation patterns under the two conditions were comparable. These observations suggest that the two conditions under study triggered, at least to some extent, similar biochemical mechanisms involving autoxidation. Throughout this study, a unique fragmentation cascade involving the 11S coffee storage protein was identified. Generated fragments shared an atypical staining behavior linked to their sensitivity to redox conditions.},

abstract = {Allosteric regulation plays an important role in a myriad of biomacromolecular processes. Specifically, in a protein, the process of allostery refers to the transmission of a local perturbation, such as ligand binding, to a distant site. Decades after the discovery of this phenomenon, models built on static images of proteins are being reconsidered with the knowledge that protein dynamics plays an important role in its function. Molecular dynamics simulations are a valuable tool for studying complex biomolecular systems, providing an atomistic description of their structure and dynamics. Unfortunately, their predictive power has been limited by the complexity of the biomolecule free-energy surface and by the length of the allosteric timescale (in the order of milliseconds). In this work, we are able to probe the origins of the allosteric changes that transcription factor mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) causes to the interactions of KIX domain of CREB-binding protein (CBP) with phosphorylated kinase inducible domain (pKID), by combing all-atom molecular dynamics with enhanced sampling methods recently developed in our group. We discuss our results in relation to previous NMR studies. We also develop a general simulations protocol to study allosteric phenomena and many other biological processes that occur in the micro/milliseconds timescale.},

Our approach was tested for 1D proton spectra and 2D HSQC spectra and compared with the method proposed by Pretsch and coworkers [1,2] [Bodis et al. 2007, Bodis et al. 2009]. Additionally, the correspondence between spectral and structural similarity was evaluated for both methods. © 2013.},

abstract = {The discovery of new anti-inflammatory drugs is often based on an interaction with a specific target, although other pathways often play a primary or secondary role. Anti-inflammatory drugs can be categorized into classes, based on their mechanism of action. In this article we investigate the possibility to characterize novel anti-inflammatory compounds by three holistic methods. For this purpose, we make use of macrophage-like U937 cells which are stimulated with LPS in the absence or presence of an anti-inflammatory compound. Using micro-arrays, 2-D gel electrophoresis and a LC-MS method for lipids the effects on the transcriptome, proteome and metabolome of the exposed cells is investigated. The expression patterns are subsequently analyzed using in-house developed pattern recognition tools. Using the methods described above, we have examined the effects of six anti-inflammatory compounds. Our results demonstrate that different classes of anti-inflammatory compounds show distinct and characteristic mRNA, protein, and lipid expression patterns, which can be used to categorise known molecules and to discover and classify new leads. The potential of our approach is illustrated by the analysis of several beta (2)-adrenergic agonists (?? 2-agonists). In addition to their primary pharmacological target, ?? 2-agonists posses certain anti-inflammatory properties. We were able to show that zilpaterol, a poorly characterized ?? 2-agonist, gives rise to an almost identical expression pattern as the ?? 2-agonists clenbuterol and salbutamol. Furthermore we have identified specific mRNA, protein and lipid markers for the anti-inflammatory compounds investigated in this study. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Proteins can sample conformational states that are critical for function but are seldom detected directly because of their low occupancies and short lifetimes. In this work, we used chemical shifts and bond-vector orientation constraints obtained from nuclear magnetic resonance relaxation dispersion spectroscopy, in concert with a chemical shift-based method for structure elucidation, to determine an atomic-resolution structure of an "invisible" folding intermediate of a small protein module: the FF domain. The structure reveals non-native elements preventing formation of the native conformation in the carboxyl-terminal part of the protein. This is consistent with the kinetics of folding in which a well-structured intermediate forms rapidly and then rearranges slowly to the native state. The approach introduces a general strategy for structure determination of low-populated and transiently formed protein states.},

abstract = {Catalytic site structure is normally highly conserved between distantly related enzymes. As a consequence, templates representing catalytic sites have the potential to succeed at function prediction in cases where methods based on sequence or overall structure fail. There are many methods for searching protein structures for matches to structural templates, but few validated template libraries to use with these methods. We present a library of structural templates representing catalytic sites, based on information from the scientific literature. Furthermore, we analyse homologous template families to discover the diversity within families and the utility of templates for active site recognition. Templates representing the catalytic sites of homologous proteins mostly differ by less than 1 ?? root mean square deviation, even when the sequence similarity between the two proteins is low. Within these sets of homologues there is usually no discernible relationship between catalytic site structure similarity and sequence similarity. Because of this structural conservation of catalytic sites, the templates can discriminate between matches to related proteins and random matches with over 85\% sensitivity and predictive accuracy. Templates based on protein backbone positions are more discriminating than those based on side-chain atoms. These analyses show encouraging prospects for prediction of functional sites in structural genomics structures of unknown function, and will be of use in analyses of convergent evolution and exploring relationships between active site geometry and chemistry. The template library can be queried via a web server at www.ebi.ac.uk/thornton-srv/databases/CSS and is available for download. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Publisher Summary Intramolecular motions on ps-ns time scales in proteins in solution can be characterized by heteronuclear laboratory frame spin relaxation nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy using established experimental protocols. The relaxation rate constants depend on the spectral density functions that quantify the frequency dependence of stochastic motions modulating the dipolar, chemical shift anisotropy (CSA), or quadrupolar interactions. The relaxation data are interpreted in terms of overall rotational diffusion of the molecule and intramolecular dynamics at specific atomic sites. Important applications of these methods have emerged for characterizing conformational entropy in proteins. This chapter focuses on a subset of 13C and 15N heteronuclear ZZexchange, Carr–PurcellMeiboom–Gill (CPMG), and R1$\rho$15 relaxation techniques that are sensitive to molecular motions or chemical kinetic processes on $\mu$s–ms time scales. Line-shape analysis or dynamic \{NMR\} is an established technique for investigating $\mu$s–ms time scale kinetic processes in solution. However, heteronuclear 2H, 13C, and 15N spectra of macromolecules usually are recorded in an indirect dimension of multidimensional proton-detected \{NMR\} experiments and the limited digital resolution hinders line-shape analysis. Consequently, ZZ-exchange, CPMG, and R1$\rho$ spin relaxation techniques are preferable for the investigation of dynamic processes in proteins using heteronuclear \{NMR\} spectroscopy. },
