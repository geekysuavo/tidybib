   abstract = {In metabonomics it is difficult to tell which peak is which in datasets with many samples. This is known as the correspondence problem. Data from different samples are not synchronised, i.e., the peak from one metabolite does not appear in exactly the same place in all samples. For datasets with many samples, this problem is nontrivial, because each sample contains hundreds to thousands of peaks that shift and are identified ambiguously. Statistical analysis of the data assumes that peaks from one metabolite are found in one column of a data table. For every error in the data table, the statistical analysis loses power and the risk of missing a biomarker increases. It is therefore important to solve the correspondence problem by synchronising samples and there is no method that solves it once and for all. In this review, we analyse the correspondence problem, discuss current state-of-the-art methods for synchronising samples, and predict the properties of future methods.},

   abstract = {The interpretation of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experimental results for metabolomics studies requires intensive signal processing and multivariate data analysis techniques. A key step in this process is the quantification of spectral features, which is commonly accomplished by dividing an NMR spectrum into several hundred integral regions or bins. Binning attempts to minimize effects from variations in peak positions caused by sample pH, ionic strength, and composition, while reducing the dimensionality for multivariate statistical analyses. Herein we develop an improved novel spectral quantification technique, dynamic adaptive binning. With this technique, bin boundaries are determined by optimizing an objective function using a dynamic programming strategy. The objective function measures the quality of a bin configuration based on the number of peaks per bin. This technique shows a significant improvement over both traditional uniform binning and other adaptive binning techniques. This improvement is quantified via synthetic validation sets by analyzing an algorithm's ability to create bins that do not contain more than a single peak and that maximize the distance from peak to bin boundary. The validation sets are developed by characterizing the salient distributions in experimental NMR spectroscopic data. Further, dynamic adaptive binning is applied to a (1)H NMR-based experiment to monitor rat urinary metabolites to empirically demonstrate improved spectral quantification.},

   abstract = {In many metabolomics studies, NMR spectra are divided into bins of fixed width. This spectral quantification technique, known as uniform binning, is used to reduce the number of variables for pattern recognition techniques and to mitigate effects from variations in peak positions; however, shifts in peaks near the boundaries can cause dramatic quantitative changes in adjacent bins due to non-overlapping boundaries. Here we describe a new Gaussian binning method that incorporates overlapping bins to minimize these effects. A Gaussian kernel weights the signal contribution relative to distance from bin center, and the overlap between bins is controlled by the kernel standard deviation. Sensitivity to peak shift was assessed for a series of test spectra where the offset frequency was incremented in 0.5 Hz steps. For a 4 Hz shift within a bin width of 24 Hz, the error for uniform binning increased by 150%, while the error for Gaussian binning increased by 50%. Further, using a urinary metabolomics data set (from a toxicity study) and principal component analysis (PCA), we showed that the information content in the quantified features was equivalent for Gaussian and uniform binning methods. The separation between groups in the PCA scores plot, measured by the J(2) quality metric, is as good or better for Gaussian binning versus uniform binning. The Gaussian method is shown to be robust in regards to peak shift, while still retaining the information needed by classification and multivariate statistical techniques for NMR-metabolomics data.},

   abstract = {Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra are widely used in metabolomics to obtain profiles of metabolites dissolved in biofluids such as cell supernatants. Methods for estimating metabolite concentrations from these spectra are presently confined to manual peak fitting and to binning procedures for integrating resonance peaks. Extensive information on the patterns of spectral resonance generated by human metabolites is now available in online databases. By incorporating this information into a Bayesian model, we can deconvolve resonance peaks from a spectrum and obtain explicit concentration estimates for the corresponding metabolites. Spectral resonances that cannot be deconvolved in this way may also be of scientific interest; so, we-model them jointly using wavelets. We describe a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm that allows us to sample from the joint posterior distribution of the model parameters, using specifically deigned block updates to improve mixing. The strong prior on resonance patterns allows the algorithm to identify peaks corresponding to particular metabolites automatically, eliminating the need for manual peak assignment.
We assess our method for peak alignment and concentration estimation. Except in cases when the target resonance signal is very weak, alignment is unbiased and precise. We compare the Bayesian concentration estimates with those obtained from a conventional numerical integration-method and find that our point estimates have six-fold lower mean squared error. Finally, we apply our method to a spectral dataset taken from an investigation of the metabolic response of yeast to recombinant protein expression. We estimate the concentrations of 26 metabolites and compare with manual quantification by five expert spectroscopists. We discuss the reason for discrepancies and the robustness of our method's concentration estimates. This article has supplementary materials online.},

However, the well-known variability of some chemical shifts in H-1 NMR spectra of biofluids due to environmental differences such as pH variation, when coupled with the large number of variables in such spectra, has led to the situation where it is necessary to reduce the size of the spectra or to attempt to align the shifting peaks, to get more robust and interpretable chemometric models. Here, a new approach that avoids this problem is demonstrated and shows that, moreover, inclusion of variable peak position data can be beneficial and can lead to useful biochemical information. The interpretation of chemometric models using combined back-scaled loading plots and variable weights demonstrates that this peak position variation can be handled successfully and also often provides additional information on the physicochemical variations in metabonomic data sets.},

Due to the large spectral size, a standard approach in NMR-based metabolomics implies the division of spectra into equally sized bins, thereby simplifying subsequent data analysis. Yet, disadvantages are the loss of information and the occurrence of artifacts caused by peak shifts. Here, a new binning algorithm, Adaptive Intelligent Binning (AI-Binning), which largely circumvents these problems, is presented. AI-Binning recursively identifies bin edges in existing bins, requires only minimal user input, and avoids the use of arbitrary parameters or reference spectra. The performance of AI-Binning is demonstrated using serum spectra from 40 hypertensive and 40 matched normotensive subjects from the Asklepios study. Hypertension is a major cardiovascular risk factor characterized by a complex biochemistry and, in most cases, an unknown origin. The binning algorithm resulted in an improved classification of hypertensive status compared with that of standard binning and facilitated the identification of relevant metabolites. Moreover, since the occurrence of noise variables is largely avoided, AI-Binned spectra can be unit-variance scaled. This enables the detection of relevant, low-intensity metabolites. These results demonstrate the power of AI-Binning and suggest the involvement of alpha-1 acid glycoproteins and choline biochemistry in hypertension.},

In an NMRPipe processing scheme, a stream of spectral data flows through a pipeline of processing programs, each of which performs one component of the overall scheme, such as Fourier transformation or linear prediction. Complete multidimensional processing schemes are constructed as simple UNIX shell scripts. The processing modules themselves maintain and exploit accurate records of data sizes, detection modes, and calibration information in all dimensions, so that schemes can be constructed without the need to explicitly define or anticipate data sizes or storage details of real and imaginary channels during processing. The asynchronous pipeline scheme provides other substantial advantages, including high flexibility, favorable processing speeds, choice of both all-in-memory and disk-bound processing, easy adaptation to different data formats, simpler software development and maintenance, and the ability to distribute processing tasks on multi-CPU computers and computer networks.},

   abstract = {For the analysis of the spectra of complex biofluids, preprocessing methods play a crucial role in rendering the subsequent data analyses more robust and accurate. Normalization is a preprocessing method, which accounts for different dilutions of samples by scaling the spectra to the same virtual overall concentration. In the field of H-1 NMR metabonomics integral normalization, which scales spectra to the same total integral, is the de facto standard. In this work, it is shown that integral normalization is a suboptimal method for normalizing spectra from metabonomic studies. Especially strong metabonomic changes, evident as massive amounts of single metabolites in samples, significantly hamper the integral normalization resulting in incorrectly scaled spectra. The probabilistic quotient normalization is introduced in this work. This method is based on the calculation of a most probable dilution factor by looking at the distribution of the quotients of the amplitudes of a test spectrum by those of a reference spectrum. Simulated spectra, spectra of urine samples from a metabonomic study with cyclosporin-A as the active compound, and spectra of more than 4000 samples of control animals demonstrate that the probabilistic quotient normalization is by far more robust and more accurate than the widespread integral normalization and vector length normalization.},

PCA is used to simplify the examination of complex metabolite mixtures obtained from biological samples that may be composed of hundreds or thousands of chemical components. PCA is primarily used to identify relative changes in the concentration of metabolites to identify trends or characteristics within the NMR data that permits discrimination between various samples that differ in their source or treatment. A common concern with PCA of NMR data is the potential over emphasis of small changes in high concentration metabolites that would over-shadow significant and large changes in low-concentration components that may lead to a skewed or irrelevant clustering of the NMR data. We have identified an additional concern, very small and random fluctuations within the noise of the NMR spectrum can also result in large and irrelevant variations in the PCA clustering. Alleviation of this problem is obtained by simply excluding the noise region from the PCA by a judicious choice of a threshold above the spectral noise. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

In this report, we demonstrate a procedure for the construction of multivariate models based on frequency domain 2D NMR data where the loadings can be visualized as highly informative 2D loading spectra. This method is based on the analysis of raw spectral data without any need for peak picking or integration prior to analysis. Spectral features such as line widths and peak positions are thus retained. Hence, the loadings can be visualized and interpreted on a molecular level as pseudo 2D spectra in order to identify potential biomarkers.

Therefore, in order to focus on significant differences between a set of spectra from control organisms and from abnormals (e.g.. humans with diseases or animals in toxic situations), recourse is made to pattern recognition or chemometric methods. This is exemplifed using NMR spectra of a number of different biofluids such as urine, blood plasma, and cerebrospinal fluid. This approach is encapsulated in the concept of metabonomics, a subject which can be regarded as complementary to studies of the genome (genomics) and the proteins in an organism (proteomics).

The basic building blocks of the multitude of double and triple resonance experiments available today are the heteronuclear multiple quantum correlation (HMQC) and heteronuclear single quantum correlation (HSQC) experiments. The goal of this article is to provide a comprehensive, pedagogical description of these two pulse sequences, with the aid of product operator formalism. Building from basic principles, constant-time experiments, sensitivity-enhanced techniques and the role of pulsed-held gradients for coherence transfer pathway selection are explained in detail.

   abstract = {Living cell metabolism is often monitored by 1D NMR spectroscopy, but the spectral resolution and the short cell lifetime are certainly limiting aspects. 2D spectroscopy does yield higher resolution but is time-consuming since acquisition of the second dimension requires several minutes. However, after only few minutes, oxygen starvation changes cell metabolism, and long acquisition times may yield spectra that do not represent the cell physiological state. Accordingly, metabolic studies of cells require fast NMR data acquisition. Here, we have applied band-selective optimized flip-angle short-transient (SOFAST)-HMQC techniques to (15)N-labeled cells, showing for the first time that it is possible to obtain 2D (1)H-(15)N correlation spectra of small metabolites directly in living cells, in a few seconds and with a high S/N ratio. SOFAST-HMQC spectra of (15)N-labeled Thalassiosira rotula diatoms cells can be acquired in 10-15 s, and, as an application, we have detected a progressive variation of the amino acid content when diatoms are exposed to UV-B radiation, with no need of long analytical procedures to quantify the metabolic changes. We believe that fast acquisition techniques can easily be extended to other cell systems, foreseeing a wide application in the emerging fields of metabolomics and metabonomics, being able to picture the "instantaneous" in-cell metabolism.},

Excitation sculpting using arbitrary waveforms and pulsed field gradients, J. Magn. Reson. Ser. A 112 (1995) 275-279] is a highly effective method of water suppression for both biological and small molecule NMR spectroscopy. In excitation sculpting, a double pulsed field gradient spin echo forms the core of the sequence and pairing a low-power soft 180 degrees(-x) pulse with a high-power 180 degrees(x) all resonances except the water are flipped and retained, while the water peak is attenuated. By replacing the hard 180 degrees pulse in the double echo with a new phase-alternating composite pulse, broadband and adjustable excitation of large bandwidths with simultaneous high water suppression is obtained. This "Solvent-Optimized Gradient-Gradient Spectroscopy" (SOGGY) sequence is a reliable workhorse method for a wide range of practical situations in NMR spectroscopy, optimizing both solute sensitivity and water suppression.

The advantage of 2D NMR in terms of minimized ambiguities in peak assignment, aided in metabolite identifications and comprehensive metabolic profiling comes with the cost of increased NMR data collection time; making it inconvenient choice for routine metabolic profiling. We present here a method for the reduction in NMR data collection time of 2D H-1-C-13 NMR spectroscopy for the purpose of quantitative metabolic profiling. Our method combines three techniques; which are nonlinear sampling (NLS), forward maximum (FM) entropy reconstruction, and J-compensated quantitative heteronuclear single quantum (HSQC) H-1-C-13 NMR spectra. We report here that approximately 22-fold reduction in 2D NMR data collection time for the body fluid samples can be achieved by this method, without any compromise in quantitative information recovery of various low abundance metabolites. The method has been demonstrated in standard mixture solution, native, and lyophilized human urine samples. Our proposed method has potential to make quantitative metabolic profiling by 2D NMR as a routine method for various metabonomic studies.},

However, a serious drawback of these approaches is the common misalignments of H-1 NMR spectra. To overcome this problem, bucketing or binning techniques have been used. In this work, an algorithm is proposed to perform an optimized bucketing that yields better results than the conventional bucketing implemented in some commercial software. The improvement proposed here for optimized bucketing deals with the bucket boundaries, which are defined by local minima from average NMR spectrum over all samples. Applicability of the new algorithm, named OBA (optimized bucketing algorithm), is demonstrated for real data sets in comparison to other alignment approaches and conventional bucketing.

   abstract = {A generic preprocessing method for multivariate data, called orthogonal projections to latent structures (O-PLS), is described. O-PLS removes variation from X (descriptor variables) that is not correlated to Y (property variables, e.g. yield, cost or toxicity). In mathematical terms this is equivalent to removing systematic variation in X that is orthogonal to Y. In an earlier paper, Wold et al. (Chemometrics Intell, Lab. Syst. 1998; 44:175-185) described orthogonal signal correction (OSC). In this paper a method with the same objective but with different means is described. The proposed O-PLS method analyzes the variation explained in each PLS component. The non-correlated systematic variation in X is removed, making interpretation of the resulting PLS model easier and with the additional benefit that the non-correlated variation itself can be analyzed further. As an example, near-infrared (NIR) reflectance spectra of wood chips were analyzed. Applying O-PLS resulted in reduced model complexity with preserved prediction ability, effective removal of noncorrelated variation in X and, not least, improved interpretational ability of both correlated and noncorrelated variation in the NIR spectra.

   abstract = {Background: Extracting relevant biological information from large data sets is a major challenge in functional genomics research. Different aspects of the data hamper their biological interpretation. For instance, 5000-fold differences in concentration for different metabolites are present in a metabolomics data set, while these differences are not proportional to the biological relevance of these metabolites. However, data analysis methods are not able to make this distinction. Data pretreatment methods can correct for aspects that hinder the biological interpretation of metabolomics data sets by emphasizing the biological information in the data set and thus improving their biological interpretability.
Results: Different data pretreatment methods, i.e. centering, autoscaling, pareto scaling, range scaling, vast scaling, log transformation, and power transformation, were tested on a real-life metabolomics data set. They were found to greatly affect the outcome of the data analysis and thus the rank of the, from a biological point of view, most important metabolites. Furthermore, the stability of the rank, the influence of technical errors on data analysis, and the preference of data analysis methods for selecting highly abundant metabolites were affected by the data pretreatment method used prior to data analysis.
Conclusion: Different pretreatment methods emphasize different aspects of the data and each pretreatment method has its own merits and drawbacks. The choice for a pretreatment method depends on the biological question to be answered, the properties of the data set and the data analysis method selected. For the explorative analysis of the validation data set used in this study, autoscaling and range scaling performed better than the other pretreatment methods. That is, range scaling and autoscaling were able to remove the dependence of the rank of the metabolites on the average concentration and the magnitude of the fold changes and showed biologically sensible results after PCA (principal component analysis).
In conclusion, selecting a proper data pretreatment method is an essential step in the analysis of metabolomics data and greatly affects the metabolites that are identified to be the most important.},

   abstract = {High-resolution, liquid state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a popular platform for metabolic profiling because the technique is nondestructive, quantitative, reproducible, and the spectra contain a wealth of biochemical information. Because of the large dynamic range of metabolite concentrations in biofluids, statistical analyses of one-dimensional (1D) proton NMR data tend to be biased toward selecting changes in more abundant metabolites. Although two-dimensional (2D) proton-proton experiments can alleviate spectral crowding, they have been mainly used for structural determination. In this study, 2D total correlation spectroscopy NMR was used to compare the global metabolic profiles of urine obtained from wild-type and Abcc6-knockout mice. The 2D data were compared to an improved 1D experiment in which signal contributions from macromolecules and the urea peak have been spectroscopically removed for more accurate quantitation of low-abundance metabolites. Although statistical models from both 1D and 2D data could differentiate samples acquired from the two groups of mice, only the 2D spectra allowed the characterization of statistically relevant changes in the low-abundance metabolites. While acquisition of the 2D data require more time, the data obtained resulted in a more meaningful and comprehensive metabolic profile, aided in metabolite identifications, and minimized ambiguities in peak assignments.},

Is this paper we will discuss a strategy based on cross model validation and permutation testing to validate the classification models. It is also shown that too optimistic results are obtained when the validation is not done properly. Furthermore, we advocate against the use of PLSDA score plots for inference of class differences.},

The use of chemometrics tools, e.g., principal component analysis (PCA), partial least-squares to latent structures (PLS), and orthogonal PLS (OPLS), is therefore of great importance as these include efficient, validated, and robust methods for modeling information-rich chemical and biological data. Here the S-plot is proposed as a tool for visualization and interpretation of multivariate classification models, e.g., OPLS discriminate analysis, having two or more classes. The S-plot visualizes both the covariance and correlation between the metabolites and the modeled class designation. Thereby the S-plot helps identifying statistically significant and potentially biochemically significant metabolites, based both on contributions to the model and their reliability. An extension of the S-plot, the SUS-plot (shared and unique structure), is applied to compare the outcome of multiple classification models compared to a common reference, e.g., control. The used example is a gas chromatography coupled mass spectroscopy based metabolomics study in plant biology where two different transgenic poplar lines are compared to wild type. By using OPLS, an improved visualization and discrimination of interesting metabolites could be demonstrated.},

It can avoid an unnecessarily large model and therefore decreases the risk of overfitting of the model. The results obtained from a simulation study showed that MCCV has an obviously larger probability than leave-one-out CV (LOO-CV) of selecting the model with best prediction ability and that a corrected MCCV (CMCCV) could give a more accurate estimation of prediction ability than LOO-CV or MCCV. The results obtained with real data sets demonstrated that MCCV could successfully select an appropriate model and that CMCCV could assess the prediction ability of the selected model with satisfactory accuracy.

Although a number of computational approaches for this task have recently been proposed, they are not entirely satisfactory in either accuracy or extent of automation.
Results: We introduce a probabilistic approach Bayesian Quantification (BQuant), for fully automated database-based identification and quantification of metabolites in local regions of H-1 NMR spectra. The approach represents the spectra as mixtures of reference profiles from a database, and infers the identities and the abundances of metabolites by Bayesian model selection. We show using a simulated dataset, a spike-in experiment and a metabolomic investigation of plasma samples that BQuant outperforms the available automated alternatives in accuracy for both identification and quantification.},
