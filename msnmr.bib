   abstract = {Com. prepns. of Ginkgo biloba are very complex mixts. prepd. from raw leaf exts. by a series of extn. and prepurifn. steps. The pharmacol. activity is attributed to a no. of flavonoid glycosides and unique terpene trilactones (TTLs), with largely uncharacterized pharmacol. profiles on targets involved in neurol. disorders. It is therefore important to complement existing targeted anal. methods for anal. of Ginkgo biloba prepns. with alternative technol. platforms for their comprehensive and global characterization. In this work, 1H NMR-based metabolomics and hyphenation of high-performance liq. chromatog., photo-diode array detection, mass spectrometry, solid-phase extn., and NMR spectroscopy (HPLC-PDA-MS-SPE-NMR) were used for investigation of 16 com. available prepns. of Ginkgo biloba. The standardized exts. originated from Denmark, Italy, Sweden, and United Kingdom, and the results show that 1H NMR spectra allow simultaneous assessment of the content as well as identity of flavonoid glycosides and TTLs based on a very simple sample-prepn. procedure consisting of extn., evapn. and reconstitution in acetone-d 6. Unexpected or unwanted ext. constituents were also easily identified in the 1H NMR spectra, which contrasts traditional methods that depend on UV absorption or MS ionizability and usually require availability of ref. stds. Automated integration of 1H NMR spectral segments (buckets or bins of 0.02 ppm width) provides relative distribution plots of TTLs based on their H-12 resonances. The present study shows that 1H NMR-based metabolomics is an attractive method for non-selective and comprehensive anal. of Ginkgo exts. [on SciFinder(R)]},

   abstract = {A review. Mass spectrometry (MS) is being introduced into a large no. of clin. labs. It provides specificity because of its ability to monitor selected mass ions, sensitivity because of the enhanced signal-to-noise ratio, and speed because it can help avoid the need for intensive sample cleanup and long anal. times. However, MS is not without problems related to interference, esp. through ion suppression effects. Ion suppression results from the presence of less volatile compds. that can change the efficiency of droplet formation or droplet evapn., which in turn affects the amt. of charged ion in the gas phase that ultimately reaches the detector. This review discusses materials shown to cause ion suppression, including salts, ion-pairing agents, endogenous compds., drugs, metabolites, and proteins. Exptl. protocols for examg. ion suppression, which should include, at a min., signal recovery studies using specimen exts. with added analyte, are also discussed, and a more comprehensive approach is presented that uses postcolumn infusion of the analyte to evaluate protracted ionization effects. Finally, this review presents options for minimizing or correcting ion suppression, which include enhanced specimen cleanup, chromatog. changes, reagent modifications, and effective internal standardization. Whenever mass spectrometric assays are developed, ion suppression studies should be performed using expected physiol. concns. of the analyte under investigation. [on SciFinder(R)]},

This is accompanied by a rapid translational activation of genes encoding mitochondrial, microsomal, and peroxisomal β-oxidn. in the liver, in part under the regulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPAR-α). A failure to express PPAR-α results in profound metabolic perturbations in muscle tissue as well as the liver. These changes represent a no. of deficits that accompany diabetes, dyslipidemia, and the metabolic syndrome. In this study, the metabolic role of PPAR-α has been investigated in heart, skeletal muscle, liver, and adipose tissue of PPAR-α null mice at 1 mo of age using metabolomics. To maximize the coverage of the metabolome in these tissues. 1H-NMR spectroscopy, magic angle spinning 1H-NMR spectroscopy, gas chromatog.-mass spectrometry, and liq. chromatog.-mass spectrometry were used to examine metabolites in aq. tissue exts. and intact tissue. The data were analyzed by the multivariate approaches of principal components anal. and partial least squares. Across all tissues, there was a profound decrease in glucose and a no. of amino acids, including glutamine and alanine, and an increase in lactate, demonstrating that a failure to express PPAR-α results in perturbations in glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and gluconeogenesis. Furthermore, despite PPAR-α being weakly expressed in adipose tissue, a profound metabolic perturbation was detected in this tissue. [on SciFinder(R)]},

Understanding the metabolic response of crops threatened with these disasters provides insights into biol. response mechanisms that can influence survival. A comparative anal. of GC-MS and 1H NMR results was conducted for wild-type and tolerant rice varieties stressed by up to 3 days of submergence and allowed 1 day of postsubmergence recovery. Most metabolomics studies are conducted using a single anal. platform. Each platform, however, has inherent advantages and disadvantages that can influence the anal. coverage of the metabolome. A more thorough anal. of the plant stress response was possible through the use of both 1H NMR and GC-MS. Several metabolites, such as S-Me methionine and the dipeptide alanylglycine, were only detected and quantified by 1H NMR. The high dynamic range of NMR, as compared with that of the GC-TOF-MS used provided broad coverage of the metabolome in a single expt. The sensitivity of GC-MS facilitated the quantitation of sugars, org. acids, and amino acids, some of which were not detected by NMR, and provided addnl. insights into the regulation of the TCA cycle. The combined metabolic information provided by 1H NMR and GC-MS was essential for understanding the complex biochem. and mol. response of rice plants to submergence. [on SciFinder(R)]},

   abstract = {Because of the wide range of chem. and structurally diverse metabolites, efforts to survey the complete metabolome rely on the implementation of multi-platform approaches based on NMR and mass spectrometry (MS). Sample prepn. disparities between NMR and MS, however, may limit the anal. of the same samples by both platforms. Specifically, deuterated solvents used in NMR strategies can complicate LC/MS anal. as a result of potential mass shifts, whereas acidic solns. typically used in LC/MS methods to enhance ionization of metabolites can severely affect reproducibility of NMR measurements. These intrinsically different sample prepn. requirements result in the application of different procedures for metabolite extn., which involve addnl. sample and unwanted variability. To address this issue, the authors investigated 12 extn. protocols in liver tissue involving different aq./org. solvents and temps. that may satisfy the requirements for both NMR and LC/MS simultaneously. The authors found that deuterium exchange did not affect LC/MS results, enabling the measurement of metabolites by NMR and, subsequently, the direct anal. of the same samples by using LC/MS with no need for solvent exchange. Moreover, the results show that the choice of solvents rather than the temp. detd. the extn. efficiencies of metabolites, a combination of methanol/chloroform/water and methanol/water being the extn. methods that best complement NMR and LC/MS anal. for metabolomic studies.

Plasma samples were collected after 7 d on each diet, and 1H NMR spectra were acquired on these. Partial least squares regression discriminant anal. (PLS-DA) on spectra obtained for plasma samples revealed that the spectral region at 3.25 ppm dominates the differentiation between the two diets, as the WGD is assocd. with higher spectral intensity in this region. Spiking expts. and LC-MS analyses of the plasma verified that this spectral difference could be ascribed to a significantly higher content of betaine in WGD plasma samples compared with NWD samples. In an identical study with the same diets, urine samples were collected, and 1H NMR spectra were acquired on these. PLS-DA on spectra obtained for urine samples revealed changes in the intensities of spectral regions, which could be ascribed to differences in the content of betaine and creatine/creatinine between the two diets, and LC-MS analyses verified a significantly lower content of creatinine in WGD urine samples compared with NWD urine samples.

Methyl-t-butyl ether (MTBE) liquid-liquid, Oasis and Empore solid-phase, and acetonitrile (ACN) protein precipitation sample preparation methods were tested using the post-column infusion system. In all cases, ACN protein precipitation samples showed the greatest amount of ESI response suppression while liquid-liquid extracts demonstrated the least. In addition, the three test compounds, phenacetin, caffeine, and a representative Merck compound, demonstrated that ESI response suppression is compound dependent. Suppression was greatest with caffeine, the most polar analyte, and the smallest for the Merck compound, the least polar analyte. Copyright 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

Here, we use a combined GC-MS and 1H NMR metabolomic approach to quantify whole-cell metab. in biofilm and planktonic cultures of the multimetal resistant bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens exposed to copper ions. Metabolic changes in response to metal exposure were found to be significantly different in biofilms compared to planktonic cultures. Planktonic metab. indicated an oxidative stress response that was characterized by changes to the TCA cycle, glycolysis, pyruvate and nicotinate and niacotinamide metab. Similar metabolic changes were not obsd. in biofilms, which were instead dominated by shifts in exopolysaccharide related metab. suggesting that metal stress in biofilms induces a protective response rather than the reactive changes obsd. for the planktonic cells. From these results, we conclude that differential metabolic shifts play a role in biofilm-specific multimetal resistance and tolerance. An altered metabolic response to metal toxicity represents a novel addn. to a growing list of biofilm-specific mechanisms to resist environmental stress. [on SciFinder(R)]},

Recent advances in understanding its multiple etiologies and pathogenetic mechanisms provide more speculative hypotheses focused on even broader somatic systems. Using a targeted tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS)-based metabolomic platform, we compared metabolic signatures consisting of monoamine and amino acid neurotransmitter (NT) metabolites in plasma/urine simultaneously between first-episode neuroleptic-naive schizophrenia patients (FENNS) and healthy controls before and after a 6-wk risperidone monotherapy, which suggest that the patient NT profiles are restoring during treatment. To detect and identify potential biomarkers assocd. with schizophrenia and risperidone treatment, we also performed a combined ultraperformance liq. chromatog.-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) and 1H NMR (NMR)-based metabolomic profiling of the same samples, indicating a further deviation of the patients' global metabolic profile from that of controls. The NTs and their metabolites together with the 32 identified biomarkers underpin that metabolic pathways including NT metab., amino acid metab., glucose metab., lipid metab., energy metab., antioxidant defense system, bowel microflora and endocrine system are disturbed in FENNS. Among them, pregnanediol, citrate and α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) were significantly assocd. with symptomatol. of schizophrenia after Bonferroni correction and may be useful biomarkers for monitoring therapeutic efficacy.

   abstract = {A review. In accomplishing successful electrospray ionization analyses, it is imperative to have an understanding of the effects of variables such as analyte structure, instrumental parameters, and soln. compn. Some fundamental studies of the ESI process that are relevant to these issues are reviewed. Analyte chargeability and surface activity are related to ESI response, and accessible parameters such as nonpolar surface area and reversed phase HPLC retention time can be used to predict relative ESI response. A description is presented of how derivatizing agents can be used to maximize or enable ESI response by improving the chargeability or hydrophobicity of ESI analytes. Limiting factors in the ESI calibration curve are discussed. At high concns., these factors include droplet surface area and excess charge concn., whereas at low concns. ion transmission becomes an issue, and chem. interference can also be limiting. Stable and reproducible nonpneumatic ESI operation depends on the ability to balance a no. of parameters, including applied voltage and soln. surface tension, flow rate, and cond.

   abstract = {We describe here the implementation of the statistical total correlation spectroscopy (STOCSY) analysis method for aiding the identification of potential biomarker molecules in metabonomic studies based on NMR spectroscopic data. STOCSY takes advantage of the multicollinearity of the intensity variables in a set of spectra (in this case H-1 NMR spectra) to generate a pseudo-two-dimensional NMR spectrum that displays the correlation among the intensities of the various peaks across the whole sample. This method is not limited to the usual connectivities that are deducible from more standard two-dimensional NMR spectroscopic methods, such as TOCSY. Moreover, two or more molecules involved in the same pathway can also present high intermolecular correlations because of biological covariance or can even be anticorrelated. This combination of STOCSY with supervised pattern recognition and particularly orthogonal projection on latent structure-discriminant analysis (O-PLS-DA) offers a new powerful framework for analysis of metabonomic data. In a first step O-PLS-DA extracts the part of NMR spectra related to discrimination. This information is then cross-combined with the STOCSY results to help identify the molecules responsible for the metabolic variation. To illustrate the applicability of the method, it has been applied to 114 NMR spectra of urine from a metabonomic study of a model of insulin resistance based on the administration of a carbohydrate diet to three different mice strains (C57BL/60xjr, BAIB/cOxjr, and 129S6/SvEvOxjr) in which a series of metabolites of biological importance can be conclusively assigned and identified by use of the STOCSY approach.},

However, the well-known variability of some chemical shifts in H-1 NMR spectra of biofluids due to environmental differences such as pH variation, when coupled with the large number of variables in such spectra, has led to the situation where it is necessary to reduce the size of the spectra or to attempt to align the shifting peaks, to get more robust and interpretable chemometric models. Here, a new approach that avoids this problem is demonstrated and shows that, moreover, inclusion of variable peak position data can be beneficial and can lead to useful biochemical information. The interpretation of chemometric models using combined back-scaled loading plots and variable weights demonstrates that this peak position variation can be handled successfully and also often provides additional information on the physicochemical variations in metabonomic data sets.},

We have reviewed the main contributions to the development of NMR-based metabonomic and metabolic profiling approaches for toxicol. assessment, biomarker discovery, and studies on toxic mechanisms. The metabonomic approach, (defined as the quant. measurement of the multiparametric metabolic response of living systems to pathophysiol. stimuli or genetic modification) was originally developed to assist interpretation in NMR-based toxicol. studies. However, in recent years there has been extensive fusion with metabolomic and other metabolic profiling approaches developed in plant biol., and there is much wider coverage of the biomedical and environmental fields. Specifically, metabonomics involves the use of spectroscopic techniques with statistical and math. tools to elucidate dominant patterns and trends directly correlated with time-related metabolic fluctuations within spectral data sets usually derived from biofluids or tissue samples. Temporal multivariate metabolic signatures can be used to discover biomarkers of toxic effect, as general toxicity screening aids, or to provide novel mechanistic information. This approach is complementary to proteomics and genomics and is applicable to a wide range of problems, including disease diagnosis, evaluation of xenobiotic toxicity, functional genomics, and nutritional studies. The use of biol. fluids as a source of whole organism metabolic information enhances the use of this approach in minimally invasive longitudinal studies. [on SciFinder(R)]},

Here using a combined metabonomics approach compromising holistic 1H-NMR profiling and targeted MS approaches, we report for the first time the metabolic phenotype of longevity in a well characterized human aging cohort compromising mostly female centenarians, elderly and young individuals. With increasing age, targeted MS profiling of blood serum displayed a marked decrease in tryptophan concn., while an unique alteration of specific glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids are seen in the longevity phenotype. We hypothesized that the overall lipidome changes specific to longevity putatively reflect centenarians' unique capacity to adapt/respond to the accumulating oxidative and chronic inflammatory conditions characteristic of their extreme aging phenotype. Our data in centenarians support promotion of cellular detoxification mechanisms through specific modulation of the arachidonic acid metabolic cascade as we underpinned increased concn. of 8,9-EpETrE, suggesting enhanced cytochrome P 450 (CYP) enzyme activity. Such effective mechanism might result in the activation of an anti-oxidative response, as displayed by decreased circulating levels of 9-HODE and 9-oxoODE, markers of lipid peroxidn. and oxidative products of linoleic acid. Lastly, we also revealed that the longevity process deeply affects the structure and compn. of the human gut microbiota as shown by the increased extrection of phenylacetylglutamine (PAG) and p-cresol sulfate (PCS) in urine of centenarians. Together, our novel approach in this representative Italian longevity cohort support the hypothesis that a complex remodeling of lipid, amino acid metab., and of gut microbiota functionality are key regulatory processes marking exceptional longevity in humans.

Biological applications of SHY as demonstrated here show promise as a new systems biology tool for biomarker recovery.},

NMR results showed that SMB exts. were dominated by 29 primary metabolites such as sugars, carboxylic acids and amino acids, which were comprehensively reported for the first time, and 8 secondary metabolites including polyphenolic acids and diterpenoids.

   abstract = {As with every -omics technology, metabolomics requires new methodologies for data processing. Due to the large spectral size, a standard approach in NMR-based metabolomics implies the division of spectra into equally sized bins, thereby simplifying subsequent data analysis. Yet, disadvantages are the loss of information and the occurrence of artifacts caused by peak shifts. Here, a new binning algorithm, Adaptive Intelligent Binning (AI-Binning), which largely circumvents these problems, is presented. AI-Binning recursively identifies bin edges in existing bins, requires only minimal user input, and avoids the use of arbitrary parameters or reference spectra. The performance of AI-Binning is demonstrated using serum spectra from 40 hypertensive and 40 matched normotensive subjects from the Asklepios study. Hypertension is a major cardiovascular risk factor characterized by a complex biochemistry and, in most cases, an unknown origin. The binning algorithm resulted in an improved classification of hypertensive status compared with that of standard binning and facilitated the identification of relevant metabolites. Moreover, since the occurrence of noise variables is largely avoided, AI-Binned spectra can be unit-variance scaled. This enables the detection of relevant, low-intensity metabolites. These results demonstrate the power of AI-Binning and suggest the involvement of alpha-1 acid glycoproteins and choline biochemistry in hypertension.},

   abstract = {For the analysis of the spectra of complex biofluids, preprocessing methods play a crucial role in rendering the subsequent data analyses more robust and accurate. Normalization is a preprocessing method, which accounts for different dilutions of samples by scaling the spectra to the same virtual overall concentration. In the field of H-1 NMR metabonomics integral normalization, which scales spectra to the same total integral, is the de facto standard. In this work, it is shown that integral normalization is a suboptimal method for normalizing spectra from metabonomic studies. Especially strong metabonomic changes, evident as massive amounts of single metabolites in samples, significantly hamper the integral normalization resulting in incorrectly scaled spectra. The probabilistic quotient normalization is introduced in this work. This method is based on the calculation of a most probable dilution factor by looking at the distribution of the quotients of the amplitudes of a test spectrum by those of a reference spectrum. Simulated spectra, spectra of urine samples from a metabonomic study with cyclosporin-A as the active compound, and spectra of more than 4000 samples of control animals demonstrate that the probabilistic quotient normalization is by far more robust and more accurate than the widespread integral normalization and vector length normalization.},

The authors demonstrate the successful application of the quantile equating method to data obtained on two typical metabolomics platforms, i.e., liq. chromatog.-mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy. The authors suggest uni- and multivariate methods to evaluate similarities and differences among data blocks before and after quantile equating.

Apart from ensuring adequate metabolome coverage and issues of instrument dynamic range, mass resoln. and sensitivity, there are major tech. difficulties assocd. with data pre-processing and signal identification when attempting large scale, high-throughput experimentation. To address these factors direct infusion or flow infusion electrospray mass spectrometry has been finding utility as a high throughput metabolite fingerprinting tool. With little sample pre-treatment, no chromatog. and instrument cycle times of less than 5 min it is feasible to analyze more than 1,000 samples per wk. Data pre-processing is limited to aligning extd. mass spectra and mass-intensity matrixes are generally ready in a working day for a month's worth of data mining and hypothesis generation. ESI-MS fingerprinting has remained rather qual. by nature and as such ion suppression does not generally compromise data information content as originally suggested when the methodol. was first introduced. This review will describe how the quality of data has improved through use of nano-flow infusion and mass-windowing approaches, particularly when using high resoln. instruments. The increasingly wider availability of robust high accurate mass instruments actually promotes ESI-MS from a merely fingerprinting tool to the ranks of metabolite profiling and combined with MS/MS capabilities of hybrid instruments improved structural information is available concurrently. We summarise current applications in a wide range of fields where ESI-MS fingerprinting has proved to be an excellent tool for "first pass" metabolome anal. of complex biol. samples. The final part of the review describes a typical workflow with ref. to recently published data to emphasize key aspects of overall exptl. design. [on SciFinder(R)]},

   abstract = {The post-genomics era has brought with it ever increasing demands to observe and characterise variation within biological systems. This variation has been studied at the genomic (gene function), proteomic (protein regulation) and the metabolomic (small molecular weight metabolite) levels. Whilst genomics and proteomics are generally studied using microarrays (genomics) and 2D-gels or mass spectrometry (proteomics), the technique of choice is less obvious in the area of metabolomics. Much work has been published employing mass spectrometry, NMR spectroscopy and vibrational spectroscopic techniques, amongst others, for the study of variations within the metabolome in many animal, plant and microbial systems. This review discusses the advantages and disadvantages of each technique, putting the current status of the field of metabolomics in context, and providing examples of applications for each technique employed.},

The first is based on the cross-validated predictive residuals of the PLS or OPLS model while the second works with the cross-validated predictive score values of the OPLS model. The two CV-ANOVA diagnostics are shown to work well in those cases where PLS and OPLS work well, that is, for data with many and correlated variables, missing data, etc. The utility of the CV-ANOVA diagnostic is demonstrated using three datasets related to (i) the monitoring of an industrial de-inking process; (ii) a pharmaceutical QSAR problem and (iii) a multivariate calibration application from a sugar refinery.

NMR spectroscopy is the technol. that is currently most widely used for the anal. of these highly complex metabolite mixts., and hundreds of metabolites can be detected without any upfront sepn. The authors have investigated in this study whether gas chromatog. (GC) sepn. in combination with flame ionization detection (FID) and mass spectrometry (MS) detection can be used for metabolite profiling from urine. The authors show that although GC sample prepn. is much more involved than for NMR, hundreds of metabolites can reproducibly be detected and analyzed by GC. The authors show that the data quality is sufficiently high - particularly if appropriate baseline correction and time-warping methods are applied - to allow for data comparison by chemometrics methods. A sample set of urines from eleven healthy human volunteers was analyzed independently by GC and NMR, and subsequent chemometrics anal. of the two datasets showed some similar features. As judged by NIST database searches of the GC/MS data some of the major metabolites that are detected by NMR are also visible by GC/MS. Since in contrast to NMR every peak in GC corresponds to a single metabolite, the electron ionization spectra can be used to quickly identify metabolites of interest if their ref. spectra are present in a searchable database. In summary, the authors show that GC is a method that can be used as a complementary tool to NMR for metabolite profiling of urine samples. [on SciFinder(R)]},

In parallel to the terms 'transcriptome' and proteome', the set of metabolites synthesized by a biological system constitute its 'metabolome'. Yet, unlike other functional genomics approaches, the unbiased simultaneous identification and quantification of plant metabolomes has been largely neglected. Until recently, most analyses were restricted to profiling selected classes of compounds, or to fingerprinting metabolic changes without sufficient analytical resolution to determine metabolite levels and identities individually. As a prerequisite for metabolomic analysis, careful consideration of the methods employed for tissue extraction, sample preparation, data acquisition, and data mining must be taken. In this review, the differences among metabolite target analysis, metabolite profiling, and metabolic fingerprinting are clarified, and terms are defined. Current approaches are examined, and potential applications are summarized with a special emphasis on data mining and mathematical modelling of metabolism.},

We describe here the use of metabolite profiling as a new tool for a comparative display of gene function. It has the potential not only to provide deeper insight into complex regulatory processes but also to determine phenotype directly. Using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS), we automatically quantified 326 distinct compounds from Arabidopsis thaliana leaf extracts. It was possible to assign a chemical structure to approximately half of these compounds. Comparison of four Arabidopsis genotypes (two homozygous ecotypes and a mutant of each ecotype) showed that each genotype possesses a distinct metabolic profile. Data mining tools such as principal component analysis enabled the assignment of "metabolic phenotypes" using these large data sets. The metabolic phenotypes of the two ecotypes were more divergent than were the metabolic phenotypes of the single-loci mutant and their parental ecotypes. These results demonstrate the use of metabolite profiling as a tool to significantly extend and enhance the power of existing functional genomics approaches.},

   abstract = {A review. Metabolomics has been widely adopted in pharmacol. and toxicol. but is relatively new in human nutrition. The ultimate goal, to understand the effects of exogenous compds. on human metabolic regulation, is similar in all 3 fields. However, the application of metabolomics to nutritional research will be met with unique challenges. Little is known of the extent to which changes in the nutrient content of the human diet elicit changes in metabolic profiles. Moreover, the metabolomic signal from nutrients absorbed from the diet must compete with the myriad of nonnutrient signals that are absorbed, metabolized, and secreted in both urine and saliva. The large-bowel microflora also produces significant metabolic signals that can contribute to and alter the metabolome of biofluids in human nutrition. Notwithstanding these possible confounding effects, every reason exists to be optimistic about the potential of metabolomics for the assessment of various biofluids in nutrition research. This potential lies both in metabolic profiling through the use of pattern-recognition statistics on assigned and unassigned metabolite signals and in the collection of comprehensive data sets of identified metabolites; both objectives have the potential to distinguish between different dietary treatments, which would not have been targeted with conventional techniques. The latter objective sets out a well-recognized challenge to modern biol.: the development of libraries of small mols. to aid in metabolite identification. The purpose of the present review was to highlight some early challenges that need to be addressed if metabolomics is to realize its great potential in human nutrition. [on SciFinder(R)]},

A combined anal. approach can improve the potential for providing reliable methods to detect metabolic profile alterations in biofluids or tissues caused by disease, toxicity, etc. In this paper, 1H NMR spectroscopy and direct anal. in real time (DART)-MS were used for the metabolomics anal. of serum samples from breast cancer patients and healthy controls. Principal component anal. (PCA) of the NMR data showed that the first principal component (PC1) scores could be used to sep. cancer from normal samples. However, no such obvious clustering could be obsd. in the PCA score plot of DART-MS data, even though DART-MS can provide a rich and informative metabolic profile. Using a modified multivariate statistical approach, the DART-MS data were then reevaluated by orthogonal signal correction (OSC) pretreated partial least squares (PLS), in which the Y matrix in the regression was set to the PC1 score values from the NMR data anal. This approach, and a similar one using the first latent variable from PLS-DA of the NMR data resulted in a significant improvement of the sepn. between the disease samples and normals, and a metabolic profile related to breast cancer could be extd. from DART-MS. The new approach allows the disease classification to be expressed on a continuum as opposed to a binary scale and thus better represents the disease and healthy classifications. An improved metabolic profile obtained by combining MS and NMR by this approach may be useful to achieve more accurate disease detection and gain more insight regarding disease mechanisms and biol.

Combined gas chromatog. and mass spectrometry (GC/MS) is one of the most commonly used techniques in metabolomics together with 1H NMR, and it has been shown that more than 300 compds. can be distinguished with GC/MS after deconvolution of overlapping peaks. To avoid having to deconvolute all analyzed samples prior to multivariate anal. of the data, we have developed a strategy for rapid comparison of nonprocessed MS data files. The method includes baseline correction, alignment, time window detns., alternating regression, PLS-DA, and identification of retention time windows in the chromatograms that explain the differences between the samples. Use of alternating regression also gives interpretable loadings, which retain the information provided by m/z values that vary between the samples in each retention time window. The method has been applied to plant exts. derived from leaves of different developmental stages and plants subjected to small changes in day length. The data show that the new method can detect differences between the samples and that it gives results comparable to those obtained when deconvolution is applied prior to the multivariate anal. We suggest that this method can be used for rapid comparison of large sets of GC/MS data, thereby applying time-consuming deconvolution only to parts of the chromatograms that contribute to explain the differences between the samples.

Each plant species displays several different natural constituents, the majority of which have not been studied as no global metabolite screen of the diverse Taraxacum species has been performed.

The aim of this study was to identify the different chem. compns. of the polar and nonpolar exts. in these species. A partial least-squares discriminant anal. showed a significantly higher sepn. among nonpolar exts. (mainly fatty acids and sterols) compared to polar exts.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS) has become a prominent tool for the analysis of complex proteomics and metabolomics samples. In many applications multiple LC-MS measurements need to be compared, e. g. to improve reliability or to combine results from different samples in a statistical comparative analysis. As in all physical experiments, LC-MS data are affected by uncertainties, and variability of retention time is encountered in all data sets. It is therefore necessary to estimate and correct the underlying distortions of the retention time axis to search for corresponding compounds in different samples. To this end, a variety of so-called LC-MS map alignment algorithms have been developed during the last four years. Most of these approaches are well documented, but they are usually evaluated on very specific samples only. So far, no publication has been assessing different alignment algorithms using a standard LC-MS sample along with commonly used quality criteria. RESULTS: We propose two LC-MS proteomics as well as two LC-MS metabolomics data sets that represent typical alignment scenarios. Furthermore, we introduce a new quality measure for the evaluation of LC-MS alignment algorithms. Using the four data sets to compare six freely available alignment algorithms proposed for the alignment of metabolomics and proteomics LC-MS measurements, we found significant differences with respect to alignment quality, running time, and usability in general. CONCLUSION: The multitude of available alignment methods necessitates the generation of standard data sets and quality measures that allow users as well as developers to benchmark and compare their map alignment tools on a fair basis. Our study represents a first step in this direction. Currently, the installation and evaluation of the "correct" parameter settings can be quite a time-consuming task, and the success of a particular method is still highly dependent on the experience of the user. Therefore, we propose to continue and extend this type of study to a community-wide competition.

From the normalized peak areas obtained from GC/MS and LC/MS and peak heights from 1H NMR, statistical analyses were used in the identification of potential biomarkers. Metabolic profiling by GC/MS provided a different set of quant. signatures of metabolites that can be used to characterize the mol. changes in human urine samples. A comparison of normalized metabonomics data for selected metabolites in human urine samples in the presence of potential overlapping peaks after tea ingestion from LC/MS and 1H NMR showed the reliability of the current approach and method of normalization. The close agreements of LC/MS with 1H NMR data showed that the effects of ion suppression in LC/MS for early eluting metabolites were not significant. Concurrently, the specificity of detecting the stated metabolites by 1H NMR and LC/MS was demonstrated. Our data showed that a no. of metabolites involved in glucose metab., citric acid cycle and amino acid metab. were affected immediately after the intake of green tea. The proposed approach provided a more comprehensive picture of the metabolic changes after intake of green tea in human urine. The multiple anal. approach together with pattern recognition tools is a useful platform to study metabolic profiles after ingestion of botanicals and medicinal plants. [on SciFinder(R)]},

Quantification by GC/MS suggested that maltose was not a reliable biomarker since it both increased and decreased in earthworms exposed to DDT and increased by just 3% with exposure to endosulfan. Leucine was not stable with the GC/MS derivatization method used in this study and could not be confirmed as a reliable biomarker. However, alanine consistently increased for both DDT and endosulfan exposed E. fetida. Alanine showed considerable variability in control earthworms (±41.6%), yet the variability in alanine to glycine ratios was just ±10.5%. Increases in the alanine to glycine ratio were statistically significant at the P = 0.05 level for the 1.0 μg/cm2 DDT dose and both the 0.5 and 1.0 μg/cm2 endosulfan doses, suggesting that deviations from the normal homeostatic ratio of 1.5 for alanine to glycine is a potential biomarker of DDT and endosulfan exposure warranting further study.

When utilizing electrospray ionization to produce ions for anal. by mass spectrometry (MS), it is important that sample constituents are efficiently sepd. prior to ion prodn., in order to reduce complexity and minimize ionization suppression and thereby extend the dynamic range of the measurement, as well as the coverage of the metabolome. Similarly, optimization of the MS inlet and interface can lead to increased measurement sensitivity. This review focuses on the role of high-resoln. liq. chromatog.

In this study, the metabolic profiles of ripe fruits from 50 different tomato cultivars, including beef, cherry and round types, were recorded by both 1H NMR and accurate mass LC-quadrupole time-of-flight (QTOF) MS. Different anal. selectivities were found for these both profiling techniques. In fact, NMR and LCMS provided complementary data, as the metabolites detected belong to essentially different metabolic pathways. Yet, upon unsupervised multivariate anal., both NMR and LCMS datasets revealed a clear segregation of, on the one hand, the cherry tomatoes and, on the other hand, the beef and round tomatoes. Intra-method (NMR-NMR, LCMS-LCMS) and inter-method (NMR-LCMS) correlation analyses were performed enabling the annotation of metabolites from highly correlating metabolite signals. Signals belonging to the same metabolite or to chem. related metabolites are among the highest correlations found. Inter-method correlation anal. produced highly informative and complementary information for the identification of metabolites, even in de case of low abundant NMR signals. The applied approach appears to be a promising strategy in extending the anal. capacities of these metabolomics techniques with regard to the discovery and identification of biomarkers and yet unknown metabolites.

   abstract = {Mitochondrial metabolism provides precursors to build macromolecules in growing cancer cells. In normally functioning tumour cell mitochondria, oxidative metabolism of glucose- and glutamine-derived carbon produces citrate and acetyl-coenzyme A for lipid synthesis, which is required for tumorigenesis. Yet some tumours harbour mutations in the citric acid cycle (CAC) or electron transport chain (ETC) that disable normal oxidative mitochondrial function, and it is unknown how cells from such tumours generate precursors for macromolecular synthesis. Here we show that tumour cells with defective mitochondria use glutamine-dependent reductive carboxylation rather than oxidative metabolism as the major pathway of citrate formation. This pathway uses mitochondrial and cytosolic isoforms of NADP(+)/NADPH-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase, and subsequent metabolism of glutamine-derived citrate provides both the acetyl-coenzyme A for lipid synthesis and the four-carbon intermediates needed to produce the remaining CAC metabolites and related macromolecular precursors. This reductive, glutamine-dependent pathway is the dominant mode of metabolism in rapidly growing malignant cells containing mutations in complex I or complex III of the ETC, in patient-derived renal carcinoma cells with mutations in fumarate hydratase, and in cells with normal mitochondria subjected to acute pharmacological ETC inhibition. Our findings reveal the novel induction of a versatile glutamine-dependent pathway that reverses many of the reactions of the canonical CAC, supports tumour cell growth, and explains how cells generate pools of CAC intermediates in the face of impaired mitochondrial metabolism.},

These observations have led to a need to identify plasma markers of fat oxidn. capacity in order to avoid time consuming direct measurements by indirect calorimetry. The aim of this study was to investigate whether prediction of fat oxidn. capacity in an obese population is possible, using 1H-NMR and LC-MS-based metabolic profiling of blood plasma samples collected before and after a high fat test meal from 100 obese women, who represented the extremes of fat oxidizing capacity. Subject characteristics (baseline anthropometrics, body compn. and dietary records) and clin. data (blood values and derived measures for insulin resistance) were recorded into a phenotypic dataset. Filtering by orthogonal signal correction, variable redn. by spectra segmentation, Mann-Whitney U tests and genetic algorithms were applied to spectral data together with partial least squares regression models for prediction. The authors' findings suggested that only a small fraction of subject variation contained in metabolic profiles is related to fat oxidn. capacity and variable redn. methods improved fat oxidn. capacity predictability. The LC-MS dataset led to higher specificity (fasting: 86%; postprandial: 73%) and sensitivity (fasting: 75%; postprandial: 75%) than classification using the 1H-NMR dataset (specificity: fasting: 50%; postprandial: 60%; sensitivity: fasting: 67%; postprandial: 62%). Inclusion of phenotypic variables increased specificity and sensitivity values in both fasting and postprandial time points. However, the moderate specificity and sensitivity values indicated that fat oxidn. capacity may only be reflected in subtle differences in the metabolic profiles analyzed. In future studies, metabolomics data may be supplemented with gene variation and gene expression data to caption the properties of fat oxidn. capacity more precisely. [on SciFinder(R)]},

   abstract = {A review. Nowadays, nutrition focuses on improving health of individuals through diet. Current nutritional research aims at health promotion, disease prevention, and performance improvement. Modern anal. platforms allow the simultaneous measurement of multiple metabolites providing new insights in the understanding of the functionalities of cells and whole organisms. Metabonomics, "the quant. measurement of the dynamic multiparametric metabolic response of living systems to pathophysiol. stimuli or genetic modifications", provides a systems approach to understanding global metabolic regulations of organisms. This concept has arisen from various applications of NMR and MS spectroscopies to study the multicomponent metabolic compn. of biol. fluids, cells, and tissues. The generated metabolic profiles are processed by multivariate statistics to maximize the recovery of information to be correlated with well-detd. stimuli such as dietary intervention or with any phenotypic data or diet habits. Metabonomics is thus uniquely suited to assess metabolic responses to deficiencies or excesses of nutrients and bioactive components. Furthermore, metabonomics is used to characterize the metabolic phenotype of individuals integrating genetic polymorphism, metabolic interactions with commensal and symbiotic partners such as gut microflora, as well as environmental and behavioral factors including dietary preferences. This paper reports several exptl. key aspects in nutritional metabonomics, reviews its applications employing targeted and holistic approach anal. for the study of the metabolic responses following dietary interventions. It also reports the assessment of intra- and inter-individual variability in animal and human populations. The potentialities of nutritional metabonomics for the discovery of new biomarkers and the characterization of metabolic phenotypes are discussed in a context of their possible utilizations for personalized nutrition to provide health maintenance at the individual level.

Less understood is the potential for phenotypic "drift" or variation that is not related to any genetic change. Recently, stock Sprague-Dawley (Crl:CD(SD)) rats obtained from the Charles River Raleigh facility demonstrated a distinct endogenous urinary metabonomic profile that differed from historical control SD urine spectral profiles obtained over the past several years in our lab. In follow-up studies, the origin of the variant phenotype was narrowed down to animals of both sexes that were housed in one specific room (Room 9) in the Raleigh facility. It is likely that the two phenotypes are related to distinct populations of gut flora that particularly impact the metab. of arom. mols. The most pronounced difference between the two phenotypes is the relative amts. of hippuric acid vs. other arom. acid metabolites of chlorogenic acid. Though both mol. species are present in either phenotype, the marked variation in levels of these mols. between the two phenotypes has led to the designation of high hippuric acid (HIP) and high chlorogenic acid metabolites (CA) phenotypes. Specific urinary components that distinguish the phenotypes have been thoroughly characterized by NMR spectroscopy with addnl., limited characterization by LC-MS (high performance liq. chromatog. coupled with mass spectrometry). Co-habitation of rats from the two phenotypes rapidly facilitated a switch of the CA phenotype to the historical Sprague-Dawley phenotype (HIP). The impact of these variant phenotypes on drug metab. and long-term safety assessment studies (e.g., carcinogenicity bioassays) is unknown. [on SciFinder(R)]},

Chem. 2005, 77, 2455). This method has some significant advantages over standard metabonomic analysis. However, when analyzing overlapped components, the selective TOCSY method can suffer from the relatively high likelihood of simultaneous excitation of several spin systems at once. This multiple excitation can cause problems both with the purity of the individual TOCSY peaks observed and with their assignment into specific spin systems. To address this problem, the possibility of using a more selective excitation is initially explored. Unfortunately, in most cases, greater spin system selectivity can only be gained at the expense of sensitivity. This is obviously an unacceptable tradeoff when dealing with biofluid samples. However, the application of the Pearson product moment correlation to the TOCSY peak integral intensities provides a test for individual TOCSY peak purity and allows for the assignment of the peaks into spin systems. The specific application of this two-stage "semiselective" TOCSY method to rat and human urine is presented. Significantly, it is also demonstrated that the use of semiselective TOCSY spectra as data inputs for PCA calculations provides a more sensitive and reliable method of distinguishing small differences in biofluid composition than the standard metabonomic approach using complete 1D proton NMR spectra of urine samples.},

By means of HPLC-NMR-MS, the structural information available from the complementary spectroscopic techniques provided rapid confirmation of the identity of the acetaminophen glucuronide and sulfate metabolites, together with a number of endogenous metabolites. In particular, the HPLC-NMR-MS approach allowed the unequivocal identification of phenylacetylglutamine in human urine, an endogenous metabolite not previously observed in 1H NMR spectra of urine because of extensive overlap with resonances from other metabolites. The analytical advantages and complementarity of NMR and MS techniques in direct hyphenation with HPLC are discussed.

(Kim-1), clusterin, lipocalin-2, and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (Timp-1), and metabonomic anal. of urine is increasingly used to indicate biochem. perturbations due to renal toxicity. This study was designed to assess the value of a combined 1H-NMR and gas chromatog.-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) metabonomics approach and a set of novel urinary protein markers for early detection of nephrotoxicity following treatment of male Wistar rats with gentamicin (60 and 120 mg/kg bw, s.c.) for 7 days. Time- and dose-dependent sepn. of gentamicin-treated animals from controls was obsd. by principal component anal. of 1H-NMR and GC-MS data. The major metabolic alterations responsible for group sepn. were linked to the gut microflora, thus related to the pharmacol. of the drug, and increased glucose in urine of gentamicin-treated animals, consistent with damage to the S1 and S2 proximal tubules, the primary sites for glucose reabsorption. Altered excretion of urinary protein biomarkers Kim-1 and lipocalin-2, but not Timp-1 and clusterin, was detected before marked changes in clin. chem. parameters were evident. The early increase in urine, which correlated with enhanced gene and protein expression at the site of injury, provides further support for lipocalin-2 and Kim-1 as sensitive, noninvasive biomarkers of nephrotoxicity.

The spectra of all the compds. revealed [M]+., products of its fragmentation [FcCHR]+ as well as products of ion/mol. interactions (protonated mol. [MH]+, binuclear ion [(FcCHR)2Az]+, dimeric ion [M2]+. and its protonated form [M2H]+). Relative abundances of these ions appreciably (more than one order) depend on exptl. conditions: analyte concn., temp. of heated capillary, spray voltage, flow rate of mobile phase and polarity of solvents. Established correlations allow the selection of optimum exptl. conditions for registration of ESI mass spectra, as required by the application. If an unknown compd. is to be identified, it is necessary to operate by using polar solvents, small concns., low temp. of heated capillary, high spray voltage and flow rates. There are high-intensity binuclear and protonated dimeric ions in mass spectra under other conditions. These can give rise to the wrong interpretation of the structure of the studied compd. At the same time, for the study of ion-mol. processes by ESI-MS, it is necessary to use concd. samples in nonpolar solvents. In this case, the dependence of reaction product yields on temp. and flow rate of the mobile phase must be studied. [on SciFinder(R)]},

Metabolites are crucial components of biol. system and highly informative about its functional state, due to their closeness to functional endpoints and to the organism's phenotypes. NMR spectroscopy, next to Mass Spectrometry (MS), is one of the main metabolomics anal. platforms.

Combination of NMR spectra of biofluids and pattern recognition methods has driven forward the application of metabolomics in the field of biomarker discovery. The importance of metabolomics in diagnostics, e.g. in identifying biomarkers or defining pathol. status, has been growing exponentially as evidenced by the no. of published papers.

Transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics have, individually, been used in wide-ranging studies involving cell lines, tissues, model organisms, and human subjects. Nonetheless, despite the fact that their power lies in the global acquisition of parallel data streams, these methods continue to be employed sep. We highlight work done to merge transcriptomics and metabolomics technologies to study zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryogenesis. We combine information from three bioanal. platforms, i.e., DNA microarrays, 1H NMR, and mass spectrometry (MS)-based metabolomics, to identify and provide insights into the organism's developmental regulators. We apply a customized approach to the anal. of such time-ordered measurements to provide temporal profiles that depict the modulation of metabolites and gene transcription. Initially, the three data sets were analyzed individually but later they were fused to highlight the advantages gained through such an integrated approach. Unique challenges posed by fusion of such data are discussed given differences in the measurement error structures, the wide dynamic range for the mol. species, and the anal. platforms used to measure them (i.e., fluorescence ratios, NMR, and MS intensities). Our data anal. reveals that changes in transcript levels at specific developmental stages correlate with previously published data with over 90% accuracy. In addn., transcript profiles exhibited trends that were similar to the accumulation of metabolites over time. Profiles for metabolites such as choline-like compds. (Trimethylamine-N-oxide, phosphocholine, betaine), creatinine/creatine, and other metabolites involved in energy metab. exhibited a steady increase from 15 h post fertilization (hpf) to 48 hpf. Other metabolite and transcript profiles were transiently rising and then falling back to baseline. The "house keeping" metabolites such as branched chain amino acids exhibited a steady presence throughout embryogenesis. Although the transcript profiling corresponds to only 16 384 genes, a subset of the total no. of genes in the zebrafish genome, we identified examples where gene transcript and metabolite profiles correlate with one another, reflective of a relationship between gene and metabolite regulation over the course of embryogenesis.

High dynamic range across a wide mass range, however, can only be achieved at the expense of mass accuracy, since the large numbers of ions entering the ICR detector induce adverse space-charge effects. Here we report an optimized strategy for wide-scan DI nESI FT-ICR MS that increases dynamic range but maintains high mass accuracy. It comprises the collection of multiple adjacent selected ion monitoring (SIM) windows that are stitched together using novel algorithms. The final SIM-stitching method, derived from several optimization experiments, comprises 21 adjoining SIM windows each of width m/z 30 (from m/z 70 to 500; adjacent windows overlap by m/z 10) with an automated gain control (AGC) target of 1 x 10(5) charges. SIM-stitching and wide-scan range (WSR; Thermo Electron) were compared using a defined standard to assess mass accuracy and a liver extract to assess peak count and dynamic range. SIM-stitching decreased the maximum mass error by 1.3- and 4.3-fold, and increased the peak count by 5.3- and 1.8-fold, versus WSR (AGC targets of 1 x 10(5) and 5 x 10(5), respectively). SIM-stitching achieved an rms mass error of 0.18 ppm and detected over 3000 peaks in liver extract. This novel approach increases metabolome coverage, has very high mass accuracy, and at 5.5 min/sample is conducive for high-throughput metabolomics.},

Rats were given a single dose of aconitine, mesaconitine, hypaconitine, or vehicle. The largest metabolic changes were obsd. 6 h after treatment. Every group receiving a dose had higher urine concns. of glucose, acetate, dimethylglycine, succinate, and alanine and had lower concns. of creatinine, citrate, 2-oxoglutarate, N-acetylated metabolites, and trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) than did the control group. These results may reflect the perturbation of renal tubular function within the first 24 h after treatment. The results also revealed a larger perturbation of metabolic profiles in the aconitine group than in the mesaconitine and hypaconitine groups, illustrating how these alkaloids exhibit different toxicities. An anal. of plasma samples collected 7 days postdose showed that there were higher levels of lactate, alanine, and lipids along with lower levels of glucose, β-hydroxybutyrate, and creatine in the plasma of the aconitine and mesaconitine groups than there were in the control and hypaconitine groups. The GC/TOF-MS data from the plasma samples showed that the no. of metabolites, with significant changes or with a tendency to change, in the aconitine and mesaconitine groups were dissimilar, suggesting a possible difference in the acute toxicity mechanisms of these alkaloids.

High-performance liq. chromatog. coupled by an electrospray ion source to a tandem mass spectrometer (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS) is the current anal. method of choice for quantitation of analytes in biol. matrixes. With HPLC-ESI-MS/MS having the characteristics of high selectivity, sensitivity, and throughput, this technol. is being increasingly used in the clin. lab. An important issue to be addressed in method development, validation, and routine use of HPLC-ESI-MS/MS is matrix effects. Matrix effects are the alteration of ionization efficiency by the presence of coeluting substances. These effects are unseen in the chromatogram but have deleterious impact on methods accuracy and sensitivity. The two common ways to assess matrix effects are either by the postextn. addn. method or the postcolumn infusion method. To remove or minimize matrix effects, modification to the sample extn. methodol. and improved chromatog. sepn. must be performed. These two parameters are linked together and form the basis of developing a successful and robust quant. HPLC-ESI-MS/MS method. Due to the heterogeneous nature of the population being studied, the variability of a method must be assessed in samples taken from a variety of subjects.

We study Leishmania donovani parasites isolated from visceral leishmaniasis patients in Nepal that responded differently to antimonial treatment due to differing intrinsic drug sensitivity of the parasites. Here, we present a proof-of-principle study in which we applied a metabolomics pipeline specifically developed for L. donovani to characterize the global metabolic differences between antimonial-sensitive and antimonial-resistant L. donovani isolates. Clones of drug-sensitive and drug-resistant parasite isolates from clinical samples were cultured in vitro and harvested for metabolomics analysis. The relative abundance of 340 metabolites was determined by ZIC-HILIC chromatography coupled to LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometry. Our measurements cover approximately 20% of the predicted core metabolome of Leishmania and additionally detected a large number of lipids. Drug-sensitive and drug-resistant parasites showed distinct metabolic profiles, and unsupervised clustering and principal component analysis clearly distinguished the two phenotypes. For 100 metabolites, the detected intensity differed more than three-fold between the 2 phenotypes. Many of these were in specific areas of lipid metabolism, suggesting that the membrane composition of the drug-resistant parasites is extensively modified. Untargeted metabolomics has been applied on clinical Leishmania isolates to uncover major metabolic differences between drug-sensitive and drug-resistant isolates. The identified major differences provide novel insights into the mechanisms involved in resistance to antimonial drugs, and facilitate investigations using targeted approaches to unravel the key changes mediating drug resistance.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Extracting relevant biological information from large data sets is a major challenge in functional genomics research. Different aspects of the data hamper their biological interpretation. For instance, 5000-fold differences in concentration for different metabolites are present in a metabolomics data set, while these differences are not proportional to the biological relevance of these metabolites. However, data analysis methods are not able to make this distinction. Data pretreatment methods can correct for aspects that hinder the biological interpretation of metabolomics data sets by emphasizing the biological information in the data set and thus improving their biological interpretability. RESULTS: Different data pretreatment methods, i.e. centering, autoscaling, pareto scaling, range scaling, vast scaling, log transformation, and power transformation, were tested on a real-life metabolomics data set. They were found to greatly affect the outcome of the data analysis and thus the rank of the, from a biological point of view, most important metabolites. Furthermore, the stability of the rank, the influence of technical errors on data analysis, and the preference of data analysis methods for selecting highly abundant metabolites were affected by the data pretreatment method used prior to data analysis. CONCLUSION: Different pretreatment methods emphasize different aspects of the data and each pretreatment method has its own merits and drawbacks. The choice for a pretreatment method depends on the biological question to be answered, the properties of the data set and the data analysis method selected. For the explorative analysis of the validation data set used in this study, autoscaling and range scaling performed better than the other pretreatment methods. That is, range scaling and autoscaling were able to remove the dependence of the rank of the metabolites on the average concentration and the magnitude of the fold changes and showed biologically sensible results after PCA (principal component analysis).In conclusion, selecting a proper data pretreatment method is an essential step in the analysis of metabolomics data and greatly affects the metabolites that are identified to be the most important.},

Recent advances in the treatment of malaria have taken place and today combination therapies contg. artemisinin (isolated in 1971 from Artemisia annua) and its derivs. have become the main weapon in the fight against this disease. Many herbal companies are now trying to make use of the success of artemisinin by selling Artemisia plant material in various formulations. We have therefore decided to test the product of one such company which claims that its capsules contain artemisinin. We have used a rapid NMR targeted metabolomics approach combined with principle component anal. (PCA) to verify that the capsules are indeed A. afra and not A. annua. In addn. the concn. of artemisinin in the plant material was detd. with a sensitive LC-MS method. This anal. indicated that even if the company has used A. annua in their capsules the dosage of artemisinin will be far to low to be effective. Our anal. shows that NMR with PCA can be a rapid and valuable tool in the quality control of herbal supplements. [on SciFinder(R)]},

   abstract = {Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a variable disorder characterized by a broad spectrum of anomalies, including hyperandrogenemia, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, body adiposity, low-grade inflammation, and increased cardiovascular disease risks. Recently, a new polytherapy consisting of low-dose flutamide, metformin, and pioglitazone in combination with an estro-progestagen resulted in the regulation of endocrine clin. markers in young and non-obese PCOS women. However, the metabolic processes involved in this phenotypic amelioration remain unidentified. In this work, we used NMR and MS-based untargeted metabolomics to study blood serum samples of young non-obese PCOS women prior to and at the end of a 30 mo polytherapy receiving low-dose flutamide, metformin, and pioglitazone in combination with an estro-progestagen. Our results reveal that the treatment decreased the levels of oxidized LDL particles in serum, as well as downstream metabolic oxidn. products of LDL particles such as 9- and 13-HODE, azelaic acid, and glutaric acid. In contrast, the radiuses of small dense LDL and large HDL particles were substantially increased after the treatment. Clin. and endocrine-metabolic markers were also monitored, showing that the level of HDL cholesterol was increased after the treatment, whereas the level of androgens and the carotid intima-media thickness were reduced. Significantly, the abundance of azelaic acid and the carotid intima-media thickness resulted in a high degree of correlation. Altogether, our results reveal that this new polytherapy markedly reverts the oxidant status of untreated PCOS women, and potentially improves the pro-atherosclerosis condition in these patients.

An ideal sample-prepn. method for global metabolomics should (i) be as non-selective as possible to ensure adequate depth of metabolite coverage; (ii) be simple and fast to prevent metabolite loss and/or degrdn. during the prepn. procedure and enable high-throughput; (iii) be reproducible; and (iv) incorporate a metab.-quenching step to represent true metabolome compn. at the time of sampling.

These stds. are the more recommended when applying metabonomics to human biofluids, particularly urine samples, due to the high degree of biol. variation compared to animals. A control study was performed, and urine samples of 30 healthy male and female human subjects were collected at intervals of 8 h twice a day for three consecutive days. Using selective multiple reaction monitoring in combination with a column-switching tool for the anal. of the mercapturate pattern, samples were screened for time and gender differences, the most common confounders. Data preprocessing parameters, alignment, scaling to internal stds., and normalization techniques were optimized by PCA [principal component anal.], PLS-DA, [partial least squares-discriminant anal.] and OPLS [orthogonal PLS] models. Great care was taken in the validation process of both anal. and chemometric protocols. Addnl., a problem of LC-MS, the combination of "different-batch" data to "one-batch" data could be solved by a batchwise scaling procedure. Based on these results, the use of metabolic profiling via mercapturates will be feasible for the detection of disease or toxicity markers in the future since mercapturates are important biomarkers of reactive metabolites known to be involved in many toxic processes.

Metabolomic anal. of the model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana, using combined NMR-MS revealed the presence of two hemiterpenoid glycosides that accumulated in leaf tissue, to ∼1% dry wt. under repeated nitrate-deficient conditions. The formation of these isoprenoids was correlated with leaf nitrate concns. that could also be assayed in the metabolomic data using a unique flavonoid-nitrate mass spectral adduct. Anal. of leaf and root tissue from plants grown in hydroponics with a variety of root stressors identified the conditions under which the isoprenoid pathway in leaves was diverted to the hemiterpenoids. These compds. were strongly induced by root wounding or oxidative stress and weakly induced by potassium deficiency. Other stresses such as cold, saline, and osmotic stress did not induce the compds. Replacement of nitrate with ammonia failed to suppress the formation of the hemiterpenoids, indicating that nitrate sensing was a key factor. Feeding of intermediates was used to study aspects of 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol-4-phosphate pathway regulation leading to hemiterpenoid formation. The formation of the hemiterpenoids in leaves was strongly correlated with the induction of the phenylpropanoids scopolin and coniferin in roots of the same plants. These shunts of photosynthetic carbon flow are discussed in terms of overflow mechanisms that have some parallels with isoprene prodn. in tree species. [on SciFinder(R)]},

Besides the process variables of both steps and the composition variables of the powder mixture, the physical properties of the intermediate granules are also used to model the crushing strength and disintegration time of pharmaceutical tablets, Multiblock partial least squares (MBPLS) regression is used to model the two-step process, With MBPLS the highly collinear granulate properties can be segregated from the process and composition variables to study separately the influence of both groups of descriptor variables on the tablet properties. This improves the interpretability of an ordinary PLS model. Two different approaches of the MBPLS algorithm are compared for the modelling of the two-step process, One approach suffers severely from correlation between the two descriptor blocks, When the correlation is removed, the approach improves.

Metabolomics is a relatively new field of 'omics' technol. that is primarily concerned with the global or system-wide characterization of small mol. metabolites using technologies such as NMR, liq. chromatog. and/or mass spectrometry. Its unique focus on small mols. and the physiol. effects of small mols. aligns the field of metabolomics very closely with the aims and interests of many researchers in the pharmaceutical industry. Because of its conceptual and tech. overlap with many aspects of pharmaceutical research, metabolomics is now finding applications that span almost the full length of the drug discovery and development pipeline, from lead compd. discovery to post-approval drug surveillance. This review explores some of the most interesting or significant applications of metabolomics as they relate to pharmaceutical research and development. Specific examples are given that show how metabolomics can be used to facilitate lead compd. discovery, to improve biomarker identification (for monitoring disease status and drug efficacy) and to monitor drug metab. and toxicity. Other applications are also discussed, including the use of metabolomics to facilitate clin. trial testing and to improve post-approval drug monitoring. These examples show that metabolomics potentially offer drug researchers and drug regulators an effective, inexpensive route to addressing many of the riskier or more expensive issues assocd. with the discovery, development and monitoring of drug products.

Since its first release in 2007, the HMDB has been used to facilitate research for nearly 1000 published studies in metabolomics, clinical biochemistry and systems biology. The most recent release of HMDB (version 3.0) has been significantly expanded and enhanced over the 2009 release (version 2.0). In particular, the number of annotated metabolite entries has grown from 6500 to more than 40,000 (a 600% increase). This enormous expansion is a result of the inclusion of both 'detected' metabolites (those with measured concentrations or experimental confirmation of their existence) and 'expected' metabolites (those for which biochemical pathways are known or human intake/exposure is frequent but the compound has yet to be detected in the body). The latest release also has greatly increased the number of metabolites with biofluid or tissue concentration data, the number of compounds with reference spectra and the number of data fields per entry. In addition to this expansion in data quantity, new database visualization tools and new data content have been added or enhanced. These include better spectral viewing tools, more powerful chemical substructure searches, an improved chemical taxonomy and better, more interactive pathway maps. This article describes these enhancements to the HMDB, which was previously featured in the 2009 NAR Database Issue. (Note to referees, HMDB 3.0 will go live on 18 September 2012.).},

   abstract = {The Human Metabolome Database (HMDB, http://www.hmdb.ca) is a richly annotated resource that is designed to address the broad needs of biochemists, clinical chemists, physicians, medical geneticists, nutritionists and members of the metabolomics community. Since its first release in 2007, the HMDB has been used to facilitate the research for nearly 100 published studies in metabolomics, clinical biochemistry and systems biology. The most recent release of HMDB (version 2.0) has been significantly expanded and enhanced over the previous release (version 1.0). In particular, the number of fully annotated metabolite entries has grown from 2180 to more than 6800 (a 300% increase), while the number of metabolites with biofluid or tissue concentration data has grown by a factor of five (from 883 to 4413). Similarly, the number of purified compounds with reference to NMR, LC-MS and GC-MS spectra has more than doubled (from 380 to more than 790 compounds). In addition to this significant expansion in database size, many new database searching tools and new data content has been added or enhanced. These include better algorithms for spectral searching and matching, more powerful chemical substructure searches, faster text searching software, as well as dedicated pathway searching tools and customized, clickable metabolic maps. Changes to the user-interface have also been implemented to accommodate future expansion and to make database navigation much easier. These improvements should make the HMDB much more useful to a much wider community of users.},

Unlike the leave-one-out procedure widely used in chemometrics for cross-validation (CV), the Monte Carlo cross-validation developed in this paper is an asymptotically consistent method of model selection. It can avoid an unnecessarily large model and therefore decreases the risk of overfitting of the model. The results obtained from a simulation study showed that MCCV has an obviously larger probability than leave-one-out CV (LOO-CV) of selecting the model with best prediction ability and that a corrected MCCV (CMCCV) could give a more accurate estimation of prediction ability than LOO-CV or MCCV. The results obtained with real data sets demonstrated that MCCV could successfully select an appropriate model and that CMCCV could assess the prediction ability of the selected model with satisfactory accuracy.

   abstract = {Untargeted metabolic profiling has become a common approach to attempt to understand biol. systems. However, due to the large chem. diversity in the metabolites it is generally necessary to employ multiple anal. platforms so as to encompass a wide range of metabolites. Thus it is beneficial to find chemometrics approaches which can effectively integrate data generated from multiple platforms and ideally combine the strength of each platform and overcome their inherent weaknesses; most pertinent is with respect to limited chemistries. We have reported a few studies using untargeted metabolic profiling techniques to monitor the natural spoilage process in pork and also to detect specific metabolites assocd. with contaminations with the pathogen Salmonella typhimurium. One method used was to analyze the volatile org. compds. (VoCs) generated throughout the spoilage process while the other was to analyze the sol. small mol. metabolites (SMM) extd. from the microbial community, as well as from the surface of the spoiled/contaminated meat. In this study, we exploit multi-block principal component anal. (MB-PCA) and multi-block partial least squares (MB-PLS) to combine the VoCs and SMM data together and compare the results obtained by analyzing each data set individually. We show that by combining the two data sets and applying appropriate chemometrics, a model with much better prediction and importantly with improved interpretability was obtained. The MB-PCA model was able to combine the strength of both platforms together and generated a model with high consistency with the biol. expectations, despite its unsupervised nature. MB-PLS models also achieved the best over-all performance in modeling the spoilage progression and discriminating the naturally spoiled samples and the pathogen contaminated samples. Correlation anal. and Bayesian network anal. were also performed to elucidate which metabolites were correlated strongly in the two data sets and such information could add addnl. information in understanding the meat spoilage process.

To gain further insight into the underlying mechanisms for the metabolic alterations induced by intake of hydrolyzed casein, we performed an exploratory investigation using proton NMR spectroscopy, multi-block PCA (MBPCA) and a multi-compartment model including analyses of plasma, urine, faeces and tissue samples from mice fed diets with intact or hydrolyzed casein and 16 or 32 energy% protein. The MBPCA superscores showed a clear sepn. between samples from mice fed intact and hydrolyzed casein diets, resp. Block loadings revealed that fecal fat content was higher, and tissue and plasma lipid levels were lower in mice fed hydrolyzed casein diets compared with mice fed intact casein. Amino acid metab. was also altered by dietary protein form, and levels of branched-chain amino acids were higher in faeces and urine and lower in plasma and spleen in mice fed hydrolyzed protein. Moreover, hepatic levels of the sulfur-contg. metabolites taurine and glutathione were increased in mice fed hydrolyzed casein, and hepatic glycogen amt. was increased in mice fed hydrolyzed casein. In contrast, the levels of glucose and its metabolite lactate were reduced in faeces, liver and plasma. Taken together, NMR-based metabolomic analyses indicated that pathways within lipid, amino acid and carbohydrate metab. were altered by intake of hydrolyzed casein, and that these alterations are likely to be underlying mechanisms for the obsd. prevention against diet-induced obesity assocd. with hydrolyzed casein intake.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is a hematologic malignancy for which good diagnostic markers are lacking. Despite continued improvement in our understanding of NHL, efforts to identify diagnostic markers have yielded dismal results. Here, we translated low-mass-ion information in urine samples from patients with NHL into a diagnostic marker. METHODS: To minimize experimental error, we tested variable parameters before MALDI-TOF analysis of low-mass ions in urine. Urine from 30 controls and 30 NHL patients was analyzed as a training set for NHL prediction. All individual peak areas were normalized to total area up to 1000 m/z. The training set analysis was repeated four times. Low-mass peaks that were not affected by changes in experimental conditions were collected using MarkerView software. Human Metabolome Database (HMDB) searches and ESI LC-MS/MS analyses were used to identify low-mass ions that exhibited differential patterns in control and NHL urines. Identified low-mass ions were validated in a blinded fashion in 95 controls and 66 NHL urines to determine their ability to discriminate NHL patients from controls. RESULTS: The 30 highest-ranking low-mass-ion peaks were selected from the 60-urine training set, and three low-mass-ion peaks with high intensity were selected for identification. Of these, a 137.08-m/z ion showed lower mass-peak intensity in urines of NHL patients, a result that was validated in a 161-urine blind validation set (95 controls and 66 NHL urines). The 130.08-m/z ion was identified from HMDB searches and ESI LC-MS/MS analyses as hypoxanthine (HX). The HX concentration in urines of NHL patients was significantly decreased (P < 0.001) and was correlated with the mass-peak area of the 137.08-m/z ion. At an HX concentration cutoff of 17.4 microM, sensitivity and specificity were 79.2% and 78.4%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The present study represents a good example of low-mass-ion profiling in the setting of disease screening using urine. This technique can be a powerful non-invasive diagnostic tool with high sensitivity and specificity for NHL screening. Furthermore, HX identified in the study may be a useful single urine marker for NHL screening.[on SciFinder (R)]},

We carried out a detailed exploration of gender related metabolic profiling of human urine using a Headspace-SPME/GC-MS approach and detected over two hundred peaks. Fifty-nine metabolites were identified using the NIST library. 1H NMR spectroscopy was also utilized, and resulted in the identification of eighteen metabolites. We find that both GC-MS and NMR are able to capture human gender metabolic differences, and their combination allows a significantly better understanding of this difference. Subtle differences between genders are found to be related to the metab. of fats, amino acids, and TCA cycle intermediates. [on SciFinder(R)]},

   abstract = {Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a major cause of mortality in human beings on a global scale. The emergence of both multi- (MDR) and extensively-(XDR) drug-resistant strains threatens to derail current disease control efforts. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop drugs and vaccines that are more effective than those currently available. The genome of M. tuberculosis has been known for more than 10 years, yet there are important gaps in our knowledge of gene function and essentiality. Many studies have since used gene expression analysis at both the transcriptomic and proteomic levels to determine the effects of drugs, oxidants, and growth conditions on the global patterns of gene expression. Ultimately, the final response of these changes is reflected in the metabolic composition of the bacterium including a few thousand small molecular weight chemicals. Comparing the metabolic profiles of wild type and mutant strains, either untreated or treated with a particular drug, can effectively allow target identification and may lead to the development of novel inhibitors with anti-tubercular activity. Likewise, the effects of two or more conditions on the metabolome can also be assessed. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a powerful technology that is used to identify and quantify metabolic intermediates. In this protocol, procedures for the preparation of M. tuberculosis cell extracts for NMR metabolomic analysis are described. Cell cultures are grown under appropriate conditions and required Biosafety Level 3 containment, harvested, and subjected to mechanical lysis while maintaining cold temperatures to maximize preservation of metabolites. Cell lysates are recovered, filtered sterilized, and stored at ultra-low temperatures. Aliquots from these cell extracts are plated on Middlebrook 7H9 agar for colony-forming units to verify absence of viable cells. Upon two months of incubation at 37 degrees C, if no viable colonies are observed, samples are removed from the containment facility for downstream processing. Extracts are lyophilized, resuspended in deuterated buffer and injected in the NMR instrument, capturing spectroscopic data that is then subjected to statistical analysis. The procedures described can be applied for both one-dimensional (1D) H NMR and two-dimensional (2D) H-(13)C NMR analyses. This methodology provides more reliable small molecular weight metabolite identification and more reliable and sensitive quantitative analyses of cell extract metabolic compositions than chromatographic methods. Variations of the procedure described following the cell lysis step can also be adapted for parallel proteomic analysis.},
